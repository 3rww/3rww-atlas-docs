PWSA: the M-29 sewershed, a.k.a., 4-Mile Run. Swissvale Additionally, stormwater data from PWSA was added into a separate prototype \u201cStormwater Atlas\u201d layer, which is available on the Sewer Atlas. As always, the editing emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. Submitted Data PWSA\u2019s data submission included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. Additionally, thematic extracts of those datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. While PWSA\u2019s submission included separate stormwater infrastructure, we did not (at this time) integrate it into the the connected geometric network in the Sewer Atlas. For Swissvale wastewater infrastructure data, which is maintained by Glenn Engineering, we used data that was submitted for but not incorporated into the 2018Q1 release. Geometry Geometry matching or attribute updates were not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing currently available RI Extent data provided via ArcGIS Server feature services by AECOM). Attributes The complete field and value mappings table used to translate PWSA records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed here . The complete field and value mappings table used to translate Glenn Engineering records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed here . Meta Tooling development If you\u2019re following along, you\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve skipped 2018-Q2 and that 2018-Q3 is coming a bit late. To support integrating PWSA data into the database, we invested more time in 2018 in building more robust tooling that supports semi-automated editing workflows. Stormwater Infrastructure Data In addition to updating wastewater data, we also extracted separate stormwater infrastructure records from PWSA\u2019s submission and hosted those in a separate \u201cStormwater Atlas\u201d layer. This data is provided as-is. In the future this data is planned to be tightly coupled with the wastewater data to better reflect the real-world connectivity and relationship between the systems. That change will be accompanied by a major update to the database schema as we adapt it to better represent non-wastewater pipe infrastructure. 2018-Q1 (v6.1.0) Summary This release is a continuation of 2017Q4 updates using data provided by Glenn Engineering. This release covers these municipalities: Aspinwall Braddock Chalfant Homestead North Braddock Sharpsburg Turtle Creek Trafford East Pittsburgh East McKeesport North Versailes Wall Wilmerding It also revisted the municipalities from the 2017Q4 release, and tightened up the edits made there. As always, our emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. As with past releases that utilized data from Glenn Engineering, we addressed specific request from data maintainer that the Sewer Atlas use the \u201clocal infrastructure ID\u201d provided in the submission in the Sewer Atlas\u2019 structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ). We conducted in-person review of edits with the data maintainer on 21 March 2018. Geometry Updates reflect major infrastructure upgrades in Trafford, North Versailles/East McKeesport (5th Ave). Geometry matching or attribute updates was not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing November 2017 RI Extent data); note though that in several edge cases where connectivity issues cropped up with submitted data, we did make minor geometry edits merely to ensure geometric network connectivity was maintained. Attributes Correction to ownership: Pipes classified as NVER in the last release were done by mistake. North Versailles Township ( NVER ) does not own wastewater infrastructure. It is all owned/maintained by the municipal authority ( NVTS ). This has been corrected. Some submitted wastewater data included separate stormwater infrastructure, misclassified as SAN , which came up during review. We reclassified these as STM and changed disabled to false . The records are retained in this way, but won\u2019t show on the Sewer Atlas and won\u2019t be included in the network trace. 2017-Q4 (v6.0.0) Summary The 2017-Q4 update encompassed a major update to the data model, data updates from several community datasets, and one round of review with the source data maintainer, Glenn Engineering. Model Updates The Sewer Atlas database schema is now better aligned with the ALCOSAN Regionalization database schema. The Sewer Atlas data model received a major house-cleaning for this update. This entailed the normalization of field values throughout the database. The goal of this effort was to clean-up the way that data classifications are represented, and update them to match the latest standards in place by ALCOSAN (w/ AECOM) for the Regionalization project. Through this effort, we did not look to change the classification (i.e., we did not reclassify any records to represent something else) for any given record. EXAMPLE: the values Yes , YES , Y , True , 1 were all found in the ALCOSAN field, which is a simple boolean-esque field indicating whether or not ALCOSAN owns the infrastructure; such values all become re-coded as Y . Where possible, the cleaned-up values were made to conform to the data model in use for ALCOSAN\u2019s RI initiative (developed by AECOM). In cases where values present in the Sewer Atlas database did not have a corresponding code/value in the ALCOSAN RI data model, we fell back to the original Landbase Systems data dictionary for the old One Overall Map. In the few remaining cases, we left the values as-is, and anticipate addressing them as we continue to make updates. Overall, the Sewer Atlas database schema is now better aligned with the RI database schema. You can see the complete field and value mappings table here , which was used to crosswalk values in the previous version of the data model to a new, cleaned-up version. Data Updates in the 2017-Q4 Release After the data model update described above, routine data maintainance was performed using data provided by Glenn Engineering for numerous communities Updates covered: Aspinwall Braddock Chalfant North Braddock Sharpsburg Turtle Creek Trafford Emphasis on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology Addressed specific request from data maintainer (Rich Hinkle @ Glenn Engineering) that for Glenn-managed data, the Sewer Atlas use the \u201clocal infrastructure ID\u201d provided in the submission in the Sewer Atlas\u2019 structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) Only one round of review, addressing basic questions; additional review will be conducted as necessary in the next release cycle (2018-Q1) Did not rebuild Virtual Laterals for this release; will include in next release (2018-Q1) Geometry Geometry edited to move the Sewer Atlas data coincident with submission in all cases, except for infrastructure within the ALCOSAN RI extents, or connected directly to it. No geometry-matching was explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing November 2017 RI Extent data), except for changes related to the general data model update described above (in which case actual values were not changed, only how they were represented). Attributes At the request of the data maintainer, we replaced values stored in the structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) on the Sewer Atlas with local infrastructure IDs, stored in the LOCAL_ID field in the submitted data The complete crosswalk of attributes between the source data and the Sewer Atlas database can be found here . Next Update (2018-Q1) The next update will focus on additional QAQC for some communities edited during 2017-Q4, the remaining datasets provided by Glenn Engineering, and portions of the PWSA service area. 2017-Q3 (v5.2.0) Summary Data provided by Glenn Engineering on behalf of Whitaker and Forest Hills; this release focused on updates using this data, as well as several requested data fixes in other locations Emphasis on geometry matching and field normalization in key fields Addressed specific request from data maintainer (Rich Hinkle @ Glenn Engineering) that the Sewer Atlas use the local infrastructure IDs in the Sewer Atlas structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) All questions resolved during meeting with data maintainer: dangling pipes in Whitaker: \u201cnon-structures\u201d (e.g., end of pipe) maintained as point feature class separate from actual structures some infrastructure included not owned by Whitaker (e.g., West Mifflin, Munhall): part of data maintainer\u2019s file used for reference (we\u2019ll use data from those municipalities to update that infrastructure) notable differences in geometry in both Forest Hills and Whitaker: the data maintainer invested a significant effort in field verification since the last update to these areas made to 3RWW\u2019s data in 2011 the prefered local ID value in the submitted data (there are several ID fields): use values in the LOCAL_ID field from submitted data No geometry matching or attribute updates explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing August 2017 RI Extent data), except for changes related to standardization of ownership values. Geometry Geometry edited to move the Sewer Atlas data coincident with submission in all cases, except for infrastructure within the ALCOSAN RI extents, or connected directly to it. RI extent data from August 2017 New infrastructure added in both municipalities Some corrections to pipe flow direction made in Whitaker, necessitated by newer field-verfied data from Glenn Engineering Attributes Owner field cleaned up to standardize names in the owner field for both segments and nodes Pipe dimensions updated The various \u201ctype\u201d fields updated Replaced values stored in the structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) on the Sewer Atlas with local infrastructure IDS, stored in the LOCAL_ID field from submitted data Upstream and Downstream Manholes updated to reflect new IDs Misc. For this round of edits, we implemented an automated attribute transfer process for key attributes: pipe dimensions, structure and segment ID fields, and infrastructure types. The application of process tool be will be refined and expanded over the next several releases. Revisited sewer structures and pipes in Collier (first updated in the 2017-Q2 release); manually updated GEO_TYP_PT and \u2018PIPE_DIAM\u2019 values. 2017-Q2 (v5.1.3) Summary Data provided by NIRA on behalf of Collier Township; this release focused on updates with this data only. Estimate +90% agreement of submitted data with existing Landbase systems data Most of the changes focused on adding pipes not previously included. Updates: primarily made to attributes, with emphasis on normalizing field values; Inserts: geometry (new pipes) w/ corresponding attributes Per curation strategy \u201cground rules\u201d: no geometry or attribute changes made to regionalization; EXCEPT where normalization of ownership field performed to match the ownership domain (just for Collier infrastructure) Remaining questions regarding ownership attributes; some uncertainty about whether builder, owner, or maintainer is being recorded as owner (here and elsewhere), handling joint ownership, etc. This is something that will be addressed globally in future updates. After first round of edits, ~dozen locations where clarity on pipe location was needed Clarified most of those locations with NIRA in meeting on May 1 2017. Course of action/resolutions captured in notes layer. Second round of edits proceeded based on NIRA instruction. Geometry adjustment of existing pipes made to comply with NIRA data. Geometry Geometry edited to move the sewer atlas data coincident with submission in 99% of cases. A new set of clarifications are being compiled for review where outstanding questions. Most cases did not require any adds or deletes, but just moving the nodes to match and using map topology editing to drag along the lines. Attributes: Ownership Owner field cleaned up to standardize names in the owner field for both segments and nodes. The data submission included datasets for both CTMA owned and private structures. The private structure data included information on the owners as well. The current datamodel is focued on government and authority ownership, so the owner field focused on four categories: CTMA \u2013 coincident features with the CTMA submission COLL \u2013 Collier Township owned infrastructure as indicated in the Private structure data Private \u2013 all other owners in the Private structure submission. Unknown \u2013 structures in the current data but are not present in either the CTMA or Private Structures. The owner fields were also not updated or standardized for the large trunk bisecting Collier. This was not included in the CTMA submission and the current data indicates the nodes are owned by Collier Township and the pipe by South Fayette.

Each layer is accessible in the both the Map Layers widget and the Attribute Table , and contains all attributes of the wastewater network dataset. >5. By clicking the Clear' button, the result layers and any Flag` inputs will be removed from the map.","title":"Method B. Trace network upstream from a specific sewer outfall"},{"location":"guide_rsi_trace/","text":"3RWW Sewer Atlas: Discharge Tracing Guide This user guide describes how to use the 3RWW Sewer Atlas in desktop and field workflows for identifying potential discharges into the sewer system. With this guide, users will learn to: find the location of interest on the map identify wastewater infrastructure on the map trace upstream from the nearest infrastructure use available reference map layers to help identify potential discharge sources The Atlas Interface The Atlas is comprised of two parts: Map Window For more information on the Map Window, see the complete help documentation . Information Window The steps in this guide refer to widgets contained in the Map and Information windows. Step 1. Get to your location of interest on the map To move the map to your current location, you can use one of several methods: Method 1: Use the My Location widget \u2026when using mobile devices in the field The My Location button will automatically map your physical location . This is useful if you are using a mobile device in the field, and need to quickly figure out what infrastructure is nearby your location. Note: this works only if your web browser and/or device has the necessary geo-location capabilities enabled. These capabilities vary by device; tablets and smartphones typically have this capability. The web browser on your device may prompt you to allow the Sewer Atlas to access your device\u2019s location: By selecting Allow , the Atlas will shift the map to your location. Method 2: Enter the address If you have the address of complaint, you can enter it into the The Search widget , located in the upper left hand corner of the map window. In the Search Widget, enter the address as: street-number street-name, city, state (optional) zip code (optional). For example, you would enter the address for 3 Rivers Wet Weather as 3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224 Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results: Method 3: Enter the Wastewater Structure ID If the ID for the wastewater structure related to the complaint is known, such as for a manhole or outfall, you can enter that into the search bar instead of the address. The Search widget located in the upper left hand corner of the map window also allows you to enter the wastewater structure ID number . To search by ID: In the Search Widget, enter the ID number. This could include, for example: manhole IDs: MH049K010 outfall IDs: A-20Z Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results: By clicking the result in the dropdown, the map will pan and zoom to that location. Note that if you enter a partial ID number, the search will return related results: Step 2. View and Interact with Sewer Data Once you have found the location of interest, you may need to identify specific pieces of infrastructure nearby. There are a few ways to make sure the map allows you to see the infrastructure you\u2019re looking for. Wastewater Infrastructure Layers This being a sewer infrastructure atlas, the map by default shows the key elements of the regional wastewater infrastructure: pipes, structures, and virtual laterals. The map Legend in the Information Window summarizes the symbols for wastewater infrastructure features that are visible on the map. The legend will change dynamically depending on the layers shown on the map. Pipes So that you may quickly get a sense of the hierarchy of the wastewater network, the pipes are shown on the map in classes by diameter in inches as follows: Virtual Laterals Zooming in far enough on the map will reveal virtual laterals. Note that virtual laterals do not represent actual pipes, but indicate likely connections from buildings to the nearest municipal pipe. Flow Direction On both Pipes and Virtual Laterals, Arrows indicate the direction of wastewater flow. Structures Wastewater structures are points on the map, illustrated with symbols that denote general function: Structures will appear at higher zoom levels. Get information about Wastewater Infrastructure Layers The wastewater infrastructure data shown on the map has numerous informational attributes about the infrastructure. To see these attributes, simply click on a feature. A pop-up window will appear. This window contains key attributes, such as the wastewater structure ID, the X/Y coordinates, and pipe sizes, and the ALCOSAN point of connection ID. Note: coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are currently shown in the NAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272). This differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget described above Text at the very top of the window will indicate if one or more features have been selected. This will often happen if you select, for example, a manhole, which will have one or more pipes attached to it, or any other features in very close proximity to one another. Use the arrows on the top right side of the pop-up window to quickly cycle through the attributes of nearby infrastructure. Get the X/Y coordinates of a specific wastewater structure Note: currently the coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are shown in the NAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272). This differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget. While both systems are accurately used to show data on this map, a future release will provide the wastewater structure coordinates in a manner consistent with other coordinates displayed on the map To get the coordinates for a specific wastewater structure, use the coordinate display at the bottom of the map window. The coordinates are updated based on the position of the mouse over the map. To get the coordinates for a specific location (and keep them from changing when the pointer moves): click the button shown to the left of the coordinates (noted in the image above with a red arrow). click the location on the map (such as on the wastewater structure) that you need the coordinates for. The coordinates will remain until the user clicks on the map again, or toggles the button. Step 3. Trace the Sewer Network Now that you have found your location of interest and identified the sewer infrastructure you are interested in, you can begin to figure out where possible illicit discharges might be coming from by tracing the sewer network. The Network Trace widget automates this analysis for you. Open the Network Trace widget in the Information Window . Click the Flag button in the widget, and then click on the map on top of the infrastructure at the location from which you want to trace. You will likely want to place the flag directly on the manhole or other structure from which you are conducting the analysis, but the trace can run from any location on the pipe. Note that the flag you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe or structure for the analysis, so it is OK if you don\u2019t place it precisely! In the widget window, click the Trace button, and the analysis will start. Depending on how many pipes are traced, the analysis may take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two to complete. You can continue to do other things with Atlas, such as pan and zoom or turn layers on and off, while the trace analysis runs. When the analysis is complete, the results of the trace are added to the map. upstream pipes are highlighted in orange upstream structures are highlighted in orange downstream pipes are highlighted in green downstream structures structures are highlighted in green As with the wastewater structure layers, you can click on the trace results on the map to view attributes of the infrastructure. By clicking the Clear button in the widget, the network trace results and any Flag inputs will be removed from the map. Step 4. Identify sample points upstream Once you can see results of the trace on the map, you can go back and use available layers to help identify potential sample points and discharge sources. Upstream wastewater structures and pipes Once you\u2019ve completed a trace, upstream pipes and upstream structures will be shown on the map highlighted in orange. You can click on the orange pipes and orange structure to get the same pop-up information you could see without the trace, as described above. Virtual Laterals Even though Virtual laterals are not traced with the network trace widget, use them in conjunction with the orange upstream trace results as a visual reference, to help identify possible discharge sources. Virtual laterals are mapped from the center of buildings. Step 5. Printing Instead of taking screenshots to capture the current map view, using the Print widget. This widget allows you to \u201cprint\u201d your current map view direct to a .pdf file or one of several image file formats, with the added benefit of providing a complete map layout with legend, scale, and title. By default the widget will generate an 8.5 x 11 inch .pdf map. To print: simply adjust the view of the map to the view you would like to save. select The print window includes an advanced options button that allows the user to customize the map title, author, image resolution, and other details. The print job is sent to a remote server, and may take some time to complete. You can use the rest of the Atlas while waiting - the job will complete in the background and notify you when ready. Supporting Functionality The Base Map and other supplementary map data By default, imagery from Allegheny County with streets and points of interest from Esri is displayed with the wastewater network data. Other reference layers Clicking the Map Layers widget in the Information Window displays all layers available to be shown on the map. These can individually be turned on or off; transparency can also be adjusted.","title":"Discharge Analysis"},{"location":"guide_rsi_trace/#3rww-sewer-atlas-discharge-tracing-guide","text":"This user guide describes how to use the 3RWW Sewer Atlas in desktop and field workflows for identifying potential discharges into the sewer system.

Changing Map Layers Clicking the Map Layers widget displays all layers shown on the map (except for the basemap) A number of data layers are available for viewing on the map in addition to the sewer data. This includes regional flow monitoring points and their estimated catchment areas several map services provided by Allegheny County, which include geodata ranging from parcel boundaries to recent aerial imagery \u201cVirtual laterals\u201d to help identify the pipe to which a given parcel is linked in the wastewater network (note that improvements to this data is ongoing) The user can opt to turn layers and sub-layers on or off as needed by clicking the checkbox to the right of each item. Clicking the down arrow on the right side of a layer displays a context menu, which includes the following functions: Zoom to : Sets the map extent to the extent of the layer. Transparency : Sets the transparency for the layer. Move up : Moves the layer one level up. Move down : Moves the layer one level down. Open attribute table :Opens the Attribute Table for the feature layer. This allows the user to view all attributes for features, and provides some other filtering and export abilities described further below. Description / Show Item Details : Opens the service description or the item details page for the service or the item associated with the layer, if available. This page includes information for linking to the feature service or downloading a static version of the data in one of several spatial or non-spatial formats. The ability to download varies by data source. Changing Basemaps Clicking the Basemap Gallery widget displays all available basemaps. The user can optionally select the base map shown underneath the map layers. By default, this is set to a high-resolution imagery map from Allegheny County with a reference layer from Esri; however, other basemap options such as \u2018Dark Canvas\u2019 may provide the user with higher legibility and clarity, especially when printing. Note that graphically simpler basemaps tend to have smaller tile file sizes and consequently will load faster. Clicking one of the basemap thumbnails sets it as the active basemap for the application. Click the x button in the upper right corner of the Basemap Gallery window to close it. Searching for Locations The Search widget is located in the upper left hand corner of the map; it enables end users to find locations on the map. To search for locations, in the Search widget enter either: Coordinates, entered as Longitude, Latitude (i.e., X, Y ); in Allegheny County: the first coordinate will generally be between -80.36 and -79.69 . the second coordinate will generally be between 40.67 and 40.19 . Addresses (e.g., 3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224) Place Names (e.g., Pittsburgh) Wastewater Structure ID Number; this looks like, for example: manhole IDs: MH049K010 outfall IDs: A-20Z Municipalities in the ALCOSAN service area Once you\u2019ve entered the information you want to search for, Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results. Note that for Wastewater Structure IDs, entering a partial number will return similar results: Advanced Searches By default, the Atlas will attempt to figure out what you\u2019re trying to search for, and return the relevant results. However, occassionally it won\u2019t be able to do this. In those instances, specify which database you need to search using the drop-down on the left-hand side of the search box: Specifically for street addresses, the arrow on the left side of the search box allows you to specify which service you want to search. Identifying Coordinates There are two ways to quickly identify real-world coordinates in the application: The coordinates of the location of the mouse on the map are displayed in real-time in the bottom left-hand corner of the map window. A button to the left of these values acts as a toggle; when clicked, it allows the user to click a point on the map, and see the coordinates for that point in the lower left. The coordinates will not update until the user clicks on the map again or toggles the button. The Measurement widget, located in the top right corner of the map window, provides the ability to place a temporary flag on the map. The coordinates are reported for this flag in the Measurement widget window. Note that the Sewer Atlas displays data in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxilary Sphere coordinate reference system (CRS). All coordinates reported in the application are in this CRS. Using the Attribute Table The Attribute Table displays a tabular view of the map data and its attributes at the bottom of the map window. It is a powerful tool for searching, selecting, sorting, and exporting data from the map. Please note that the wastewater network contains over 125,000 features. Certain operations conducted on the entire dataset in the Attribute Table , such as sorting, will take time to complete. Opening the table The attribute table can be opened two ways: clicking the arrow/tab at the bottom of the map window though the Map Layers widget in the information window, clicking the down arrow on the right side of a layer, which will open a context menu with an Open attribute table option. When more than one layer\u2019s attributes display, multiple tabs automatically generate in the attribute panel allowing you to switch among the attribute tables. Using the table Clicking a record in the table selects it and highlights the corresponding feature in the map with the color specified in the Attribute Table widget configuration window. Press the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple records. By Clicking a field heading , the table will sort the records by the field. Buttons at the top of table help manage the selection and the way the table displays: An Options menu provides advanced selection, filtering, and exporting options. More on this later. Zoom to selected: features\u2014Clicking Zoom to resets the map extent to center around selected features. Clear selections: \u2014Clicking the Clear Selection button clears all selections. Refresh \u2014Clicking Refresh refreshes the tables. Show or hide columns: \u2014Clicking the + icon on the right side of the Attribute Table panel opens the field visibility window. Check or uncheck the fields to set them to visible or invisible in the table. Number of selected records\u2014Shown on the lower left of the table. Can also be accessed from the Options menu. Selecting and Filtering records and features The Attribute Table provides the user to dig deep into the data and manipulate what data is shown on the map. Through the Options menu on the table, you can select or filter records in the table, which in turn highlights or filters, respectively, the corresponding features on the map. The available options Show Selected Records: Only displays selected records. By hiding records you haven\u2019t selected, it may be easier to visually browse the table. Show Related Records: Note: the Sewer Atlas does not currently have related tables. Displays related records if a selected record has related table. Filter: Allows the user to specify a query that will filter records in the table. Filter by Map Extent: This option only displays attributes in the table for features within the current map extent. Exporting records from the table The Options menu provides an Export to CSV tool, which creates a file that can be opened in Microsoft Excel, other spreadsheet software, or a text editor. If records are selected and/or a filter is applied, only the selected and/or filtered records are exported. If no records are selected or filtered, all the records are exported. Querying Features The Query widget provides a way to run predefined and custom queries to highlight specific features on the map\u2013these features can then be summarized and exported in multiple formats. Currently, two predefined queries are setup: Highlight by Point of Connection (POC) Highlight by Owner Note: these can easily be expanded/modified to meet user requirements based on available data - just ask! Selecting one of these options in the Query window will take you to an options screen, where you are presented with two options: Attribute criteria and Spatial Filter . Minimally, you need to select an attribute criterion, and leave the spatial filter set to its default option. Attribute criteria This lets you select the attribute you are looking for. For POC, this is the POC code (e.g., M-44); For Owner, it is the owner name. You can enter text\u2013it will attempt to guess what you\u2019re looking for\u2013or use the drop-down to select available values to search for. Spatial Filter (optional) This lets you pick a way to spatially filter the data returned by the selected attribute criteria. Return features within full extent of the map (Default): All features meeting attribute criteria will be returned, regardless of whether you can see them currently in the map window. Only return features within current map extent : Returns only features meeting the attribute criteria that you can see within the map window currently. Only return features that intersect with shape drawn on the map : This lets you draw a polygon on the map. Only features that meet your attribute criteria and intersect that polygon will be returned. Only return features that have a spatial relationship with features in another layer (under development): Similiar to the drawing option above, this lets you use another feature in addition to your attribute criteria to select features. The difference here is that it takes a feature you have selected from another layer. For example, you could select a sewershed in the sewersheds layer, specify that layer here, and it will be used to narrow the query results. Running and Query and Using the Results Once you\u2019ve set up the query options, hit the Execute button. A list of pipes selected in the query will appear in the info window. Clicking on one of the list items will focus the map on that pipe. At the top right of the results is a \u201c. . .\u2019 button. This provides further options for using the results. Of note: Export to CSV file: exports results as a table, for use in spreadsheet programs Export to Feature Colletion : exports results as a GeoJSON file, for use on a web map Export to Shapefile : exports results as a shapefile, which is is used in GIS and CAD software. Statistics... : Performs basic statistics (e.g., sum, average, etc.) on the queried features. By default this is performed using the length field. View in Attribute Table : Creates a view of just the queried records and select fields in the Attribute Table . Filtering Map Features See Using the Attribute Table >>> Selecting and Filtering records and features for instructions on how to filter features. Tracing the Wastewater Network The Network Trace widget allows the user to identify upstream and downstream wastewater pipes and structures from any given point. It automatically runs both upstream and downstream traces, returning connected wastewater pipes and structures in both directions. It provides a basic summary of these features along with the ability to download the complete results. Tracing from a point on the network Tracing is initiated from one (or more) Flag inputs that the user places on the map. Open the widget, click the Flag button, and select the desired location(s) on the map. Note that the location you pick does not need to be ultra-precise; the point you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe once the trace is initiated. Click Run and the trace will commence. The results of the trace are added to the map in 4 new layers: upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures. These new layers are effectively copies of the traced pipes and structures from the wastewater network dataset. Each layer is accessible in the both the Map Layers widget and the Attribute Table , and contains all attributes of the wastewater network dataset. By clicking the Clear' button, the result layers and any Flag` inputs will be removed from the map. Viewing and using tracing results The tracing results are shown in the widget window in a series of expandable tabs. The first tab provides a summary count of upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures for quick reference. The tabs that follow list pipes and structures that were traced upstream and downstream. Clicking on any item will highlight the item on the map. The results can be downloaded by clicking the download .csv button.

SemVer was originally developed for software versioning as a way to indicate major, minor, and patch changes to software. With the Sewer Atlas, we use it o indicate the nature of changes to both the schema and the data itself. The SemVer Concept The Semantic Versioning website provides a quick summary: Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. SemVer as adapted for Sewer Atlas data versioning In the context of a data versioning, we\u2019ve adapted to concept of Semver to mean the following MAJOR version : when the database schema changes e.g. 6 .2.1 If the change requires a database migration, it\u2019s a major version change. Most likely, software utilizing the database will need to be adjusted to handle the different data schema (e.g., ensuring that a web map is using the correct column in the table for renderning a label). MINOR version : when records in the database are added/updated e.g. 6. 2 .1 Planned changes to signifcant portions of records in the database, as is done in quarterly release cycles, represent MINOR version changes. Software utilizing the database should continue to function as it would; no changes to schema occur in a MINOR version change. PATCH version : when edits are needed to address a problem with the data e.g. 6.2. 1 Problems with the data that cannot wait for a quarterly release cycle are addressed with patch changes. The types of problems addressed with a PATCH version might include: fixing issues with geometric network connectivity (i.e., the topology of pipe network was not maintained in error, and needs to be fixed for tracing to work); incorporating timely changes to specific locations of interest to 3RWW partners between releases The semi-automated QAQC process during the quarterly release cycle (typically MINOR version changes) largely lets us identify problems between releases, which is why these types of versions are rare. SemVer and Year-Quarter release tagging We label releases with a Year-Quarter tag following a YYYY-Q*n* pattern, e.g., 2018-Q1. How does this differ from SemVer, and why do we do both? The quarterly release tag merely indicates when updated data will be or was released SemVer indicates the nature of the changes since the last version at a high level Epilogue Our use of SemVer for tagging database releases is largely experimental. Our eventual goal is evolve the \u201cstandard\u201d conveyed above into our editing post-processing toolchain, such that we can qualify changes in a semi-automated way.
