The changelog is maintained on Github . 2019-Q4 (v6.6.0) Summary The 2019 Q4 udpate completed the update of PWSA coverage within the Sewer Atlas. This includes separate stormwater infrastructure. Edits emphasized geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. Once edits were complete, we additionally double-checked network topology across the entire system, and batch-updated infrastructure status (i.e., abandoned) as it related to network tracing. PWSA A fresh submission from PWSA (current through October 2019) was used for this latest release. It included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. These layers included all nodes and pipes as they are exported from PWSA\u2019s InfoAsset Manager (IAM) software and contain abandoned features as well as point features such as reducers and lateral connections (these are typically removed from the primary sewer layers already provided). Additionally, subsets of those two datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. As PWSA\u2019s IAM database does not model network connectivity the same way the Sewer Atlas database does, we focused on testing network connectivity during the QAQC process. This was necessary specifically around the overflows and outfalls in the vicinity of ALCOSAN interceptors: while in the Sewer Atlas the overflow is represented with virtual network segments and nodes, that is not the case in PWSA\u2019s IAM database. To balance these approaches, we updated locations for non-virtual nodes and segments to match PWSA\u2019s data while preserving the network connectivity with the Sewer Atlas\u2019s existing virtual nodes and segments. 2019-Q2 (v6.5.0) Summary The 2019 Q2 udpate included updates to coverage for Shaler Township, Ross Township, and the PWSA service area. As always, the editing emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. Ross Ross data was provided in two file geodatabases: one for separate stormwater infrastructure, and one for wastewater (separate and combined) infrastructure. Each geodatabase contained feature classes prefixed with the system type (storm or sewer). The owner field for Ross contained numeric values; though these values appear to correlate with owner names on corresponding features in the Sewer Atlas (e.g., 1 in source data == \u201cROSS\u201d in target), we did not explicitly pull these over during editing System (storm, sanitary) and type (manhole, outfall, etc.) information was inferred from the names of the point feature classes, as the data model did not always explicity contain that information in dedicated system or type fields. We pre-calculated a SEWERTYPE field on our composite source data, inferring this data from the source file geodatabase names and source feature class names Ross crosswalk Shaler The schema of the Shaler data appears to be derived from the original One Overall Map model. However, only a small subset of the fields were provided. Shaler crosswalk PWSA PWSA\u2019s data submission, which was used in several previous quarterly releases, included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. Additionally, thematic extracts of those datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. Updated coverage in the Sewer Atlas for the PWSA service area now includes to all sewersheds from the City\u2019s eastern border between the Allegheny and Monongahela west to the Point. This also includes separate stormwater infrastructure data. PWSA crosswalk 2019-Q1 (v6.4.0) Summary The 2019 Q1 udpate included updates to coverage for McKees Rocks and Stowe Township. Additionally, some backfilling of PWSA separate stormwater infrastructure data was performed in previously edited areas in the M-47, A-42, and M-29 sewersheds. As always, the editing emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. McKees Rocks and Stowe Township Updates Data for McKees Rocks and Stowe was provided by NIRA Engineering. Stowe data was provided as two flat tables for point and linear features. McKees Rocks data was provided as an Esri File Geodatabase, with distinct feature datasets for Stormwater and Sanitary systems, each containing feature classes further separating components by function (e.g., stormwater inlets, sewer manholes, force mains, gravity mains, etc.) Update Highlights In McKees Rocks and Stowe, notable differences between existing Sewer Atlas data here (last updated in 2011) and the submitted data were identified along the CSX railroad corridor that bisects McKees Rocks and runs through Stowe. New stormwater infrastructure and improved precision of surrounding wastewater infrastructure locations contributed to these changes. Data Preparation Notes Prepping the McKees Rocks data for ingest into the Sewer Atlas presented some challenges. The provided data had be heavily conditioned prior to our standard editing pre-processing steps (where we crosswalk the schema of provided data to the Sewer Atlas schema). Stowe data did not require this additional step. The complete field and value mappings table used to translate records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed at these links: McKees Rocks crosswalk Stowe crosswalk Below summarizes some of the challenges of data preparation and editing specifically for McKees Rocks. System type The attribute indicating system type (e.g., separate sanitary, separate storm, combined) was found primarily in the SEWERTYPE field and several other fields. It was also de-facto established by feature classes into which data was originally provided. Sometimes this information conflicted. The source data did not make a great distinction between combine and separate sanitary systems (McKees Rocks is largely separate). To accurately discern system type from the available data, we looked for in four different locations in the provided dataset for that information, falling back as necessary: SEWERTYPE field > NETWORK field > prefix of the name of the feature class (e.g., ss for separate sanitary, sw for stormwater) > feature dataset name (e.g., separate sewer, stormwater) During editing, we also noted branches of the network that appear to have been mislabeled given the context: e.g., pipes shown as combined sanitary/storm flowing into pipes shown as separate sanitary, or storm flowing into separate sanitary. We confirmed with NIRA that McKees Rocks has a combined sewer system; this means that the previous data (from 2011) and submitted data was not labeled according the data standards in use at that time. Local ID numbers This information was partially provided in several different fields; it appears to be in flux. We used FACILITYID in the source data when available. Editing Notes In general and consistent with our normal approach, we snapped Sewer Atlas geometries to the provided data. However, we did note a number of locations where the submitted data did not provide topological connectivity, though the Sewer Atlas did. In those locations we left the Sewer Atlas data as-is. This was prevalent around overflow structures and pump stations, where the convention in the Sewer Atlas is to use schematic representations of connections to ensure that the network is traceable. The provided data does not appear to use that convention. PWSA Updates PWSA\u2019s data submission, which was used in the previous two quarterly releases, included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. Additionally, thematic extracts of those datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. Update Highlights In the M-47, A-42, and M-29 sewersheds within the PWSA service area, we added separate stormwater infrastructure records. The complete field and value mappings table used to translate PWSA records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed here . Other Updates Geometry matching or attribute updates were not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing currently available RI Extent data provided via ArcGIS Server feature services by AECOM). The RI data will be addressed explicitly in a later release. 2018-Q4 (v6.3.0) Summary This release focused on continuing to integrate updated data from PWSA. portions of the M-47 sewershed, a.k.a., 9-Mile Run, within the PWSA service area the A-42 sewershed, a.k.a., Negley Run. With the completion of these two sewersheds, we\u2019ve provided coverage for the eastern side of the City of Pittsburgh from river to river. Note the 9-Mile run was also been partially tackled in the 2018-Q3 release (with Swissvale). As always, the editing emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. Submitted Data PWSA\u2019s data submission included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. Additionally, thematic extracts of those datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. Geometry Geometry matching or attribute updates were not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing currently available RI Extent data provided via ArcGIS Server feature services by AECOM). Attributes The complete field and value mappings table used to translate PWSA records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed here . Meta Stormwater data integration PWSA\u2019s data includes separate stormwater infrastructure. Since the existing schema carried over from the original ACHD data model already accomodated separate stormwater infrastructure records, and stormwater data is of interest, we experimented with incorporating some of those records into the the Sewer Atlas database. The incorporation of this data was limited in geographic scope\u2014mostly confined to the areas in and around the Summerset development in the 9-Mile Run watershed. Those records are provided in the downloadable versions of the Sewer Atlas databases (e.g., FGDB, MPK, GPKG, SHP) but will not appear on the wastewater layers of Sewer Atlas web application (yet; you\u2019ll still find all separate stormwater data in the \u201cstormwater atlas beta layer\u201d). In the downloadable copies, you\u2019ll find them classified as STM in the SEWERTYPE field. 2019 releases will likely contain more of this data at a broader geographic scale. 2018-Q3 (v6.2.0) Summary This release focused on beginning to integrate updated wastewater data from PWSA, along with additional edits for communities in previous releases. PWSA: the M-29 sewershed, a.k.a., 4-Mile Run. Swissvale Additionally, stormwater data from PWSA was added into a separate prototype \u201cStormwater Atlas\u201d layer, which is available on the Sewer Atlas. As always, the editing emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. Submitted Data PWSA\u2019s data submission included complete exports of point and polyline datasets, in_node and in_pipe , respectively, as Esri shapefiles. Additionally, thematic extracts of those datasets were provided; e.g., Sewers and Abandoned Sewers were provided representing mutually-exclusive subsets of the in_pipe dataset derived from values in that table\u2019s Status field. While PWSA\u2019s submission included separate stormwater infrastructure, we did not (at this time) integrate it into the the connected geometric network in the Sewer Atlas. For Swissvale wastewater infrastructure data, which is maintained by Glenn Engineering, we used data that was submitted for but not incorporated into the 2018Q1 release. Geometry Geometry matching or attribute updates were not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing currently available RI Extent data provided via ArcGIS Server feature services by AECOM). Attributes The complete field and value mappings table used to translate PWSA records to the Sewer Atlas schema can be viewed here . The same mapping table used to translate Glenn Engineering records can be viewed here . Meta Tooling development If you\u2019re following along, you\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve skipped 2018-Q2 and that 2018-Q3 is coming a bit late. To support integrating PWSA data into the database, we invested more time in 2018 in building more robust tooling that supports semi-automated editing workflows. Stormwater Infrastructure Data In addition to updating wastewater data, we also extracted separate stormwater infrastructure records from PWSA\u2019s submission and hosted those in a separate \u201cStormwater Atlas\u201d layer. This data is provided as-is. In the future this data is planned to be tightly coupled with the wastewater data to better reflect the real-world connectivity and relationship between the systems. That change will be accompanied by a major update to the database schema as we adapt it to better represent non-wastewater pipe infrastructure. 2018-Q1 (v6.1.0) Summary This release is a continuation of 2017Q4 updates using data provided by Glenn Engineering. This release covers these municipalities: Aspinwall Braddock Chalfant Homestead North Braddock Sharpsburg Turtle Creek Trafford East Pittsburgh East McKeesport North Versailes Wall Wilmerding It also revisted the municipalities from the 2017Q4 release, and tightened up the edits made there. As always, our emphasis was on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology. As with past releases that utilized data from Glenn Engineering, we addressed specific request from data maintainer that the Sewer Atlas use the \u201clocal infrastructure ID\u201d provided in the submission in the Sewer Atlas\u2019 structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ). We conducted in-person review of edits with the data maintainer on 21 March 2018. Geometry Updates reflect major infrastructure upgrades in Trafford, North Versailles/East McKeesport (5th Ave). Geometry matching or attribute updates was not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing November 2017 RI Extent data); note though that in several edge cases where connectivity issues cropped up with submitted data, we did make minor geometry edits merely to ensure geometric network connectivity was maintained. Attributes Correction to ownership: Pipes classified as NVER in the last release were done by mistake. North Versailles Township ( NVER ) does not own wastewater infrastructure. It is all owned/maintained by the municipal authority ( NVTS ). This has been corrected. Some submitted wastewater data included separate stormwater infrastructure, misclassified as SAN , which came up during review. We reclassified these as STM and changed disabled to false . The records are retained in this way, but won\u2019t show on the Sewer Atlas and won\u2019t be included in the network trace. 2017-Q4 (v6.0.0) Summary The 2017-Q4 update encompassed a major update to the data model, data updates from several community datasets, and one round of review with the source data maintainer, Glenn Engineering. Model Updates The Sewer Atlas database schema is now better aligned with the ALCOSAN Regionalization database schema. The Sewer Atlas data model received a major house-cleaning for this update. This entailed the normalization of field values throughout the database. The goal of this effort was to clean-up the way that data classifications are represented, and update them to match the latest standards in place by ALCOSAN (w/ AECOM) for the Regionalization project. Through this effort, we did not look to change the classification (i.e., we did not reclassify any records to represent something else) for any given record. EXAMPLE: the values Yes , YES , Y , True , 1 were all found in the ALCOSAN field, which is a simple boolean-esque field indicating whether or not ALCOSAN owns the infrastructure; such values all become re-coded as Y . Where possible, the cleaned-up values were made to conform to the data model in use for ALCOSAN\u2019s RI initiative (developed by AECOM). In cases where values present in the Sewer Atlas database did not have a corresponding code/value in the ALCOSAN RI data model, we fell back to the original Landbase Systems data dictionary for the old One Overall Map. In the few remaining cases, we left the values as-is, and anticipate addressing them as we continue to make updates. Overall, the Sewer Atlas database schema is now better aligned with the RI database schema. You can see the complete field and value mappings table here , which was used to crosswalk values in the previous version of the data model to a new, cleaned-up version. Data Updates in the 2017-Q4 Release After the data model update described above, routine data maintainance was performed using data provided by Glenn Engineering for numerous communities Updates covered: Aspinwall Braddock Chalfant North Braddock Sharpsburg Turtle Creek Trafford Emphasis on geometry matching and attritbute updates for key fields related to infrastructure dimensionality and typology Addressed specific request from data maintainer (Rich Hinkle @ Glenn Engineering) that for Glenn-managed data, the Sewer Atlas use the \u201clocal infrastructure ID\u201d provided in the submission in the Sewer Atlas\u2019 structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) Only one round of review, addressing basic questions; additional review will be conducted as necessary in the next release cycle (2018-Q1) Did not rebuild Virtual Laterals for this release; will include in next release (2018-Q1) Geometry Geometry edited to move the Sewer Atlas data coincident with submission in all cases, except for infrastructure within the ALCOSAN RI extents, or connected directly to it. No geometry-matching was explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing November 2017 RI Extent data), except for changes related to the general data model update described above (in which case actual values were not changed, only how they were represented). Attributes At the request of the data maintainer, we replaced values stored in the structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) on the Sewer Atlas with local infrastructure IDs, stored in the LOCAL_ID field in the submitted data The complete crosswalk of attributes between the source data and the Sewer Atlas database can be found here . Next Update (2018-Q1) The next update will focus on additional QAQC for some communities edited during 2017-Q4, the remaining datasets provided by Glenn Engineering, and portions of the PWSA service area. 2017-Q3 (v5.2.0) Summary Data provided by Glenn Engineering on behalf of Whitaker and Forest Hills; this release focused on updates using this data, as well as several requested data fixes in other locations Emphasis on geometry matching and field normalization in key fields Addressed specific request from data maintainer (Rich Hinkle @ Glenn Engineering) that the Sewer Atlas use the local infrastructure IDs in the Sewer Atlas structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) All questions resolved during meeting with data maintainer: dangling pipes in Whitaker: \u201cnon-structures\u201d (e.g., end of pipe) maintained as point feature class separate from actual structures some infrastructure included not owned by Whitaker (e.g., West Mifflin, Munhall): part of data maintainer\u2019s file used for reference (we\u2019ll use data from those municipalities to update that infrastructure) notable differences in geometry in both Forest Hills and Whitaker: the data maintainer invested a significant effort in field verification since the last update to these areas made to 3RWW\u2019s data in 2011 the prefered local ID value in the submitted data (there are several ID fields): use values in the LOCAL_ID field from submitted data No geometry matching or attribute updates explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing August 2017 RI Extent data), except for changes related to standardization of ownership values. Geometry Geometry edited to move the Sewer Atlas data coincident with submission in all cases, except for infrastructure within the ALCOSAN RI extents, or connected directly to it. RI extent data from August 2017 New infrastructure added in both municipalities Some corrections to pipe flow direction made in Whitaker, necessitated by newer field-verfied data from Glenn Engineering Attributes Owner field cleaned up to standardize names in the owner field for both segments and nodes Pipe dimensions updated The various \u201ctype\u201d fields updated Replaced values stored in the structure ID field ( STRUCT_ID ) on the Sewer Atlas with local infrastructure IDS, stored in the LOCAL_ID field from submitted data Upstream and Downstream Manholes updated to reflect new IDs Misc. For this round of edits, we implemented an automated attribute transfer process for key attributes: pipe dimensions, structure and segment ID fields, and infrastructure types. The application of process tool be will be refined and expanded over the next several releases. Revisited sewer structures and pipes in Collier (first updated in the 2017-Q2 release); manually updated GEO_TYP_PT and \u2018PIPE_DIAM\u2019 values. 2017-Q2 (v5.1.3) Summary Data provided by NIRA on behalf of Collier Township; this release focused on updates with this data only. Estimate +90% agreement of submitted data with existing Landbase systems data Most of the changes focused on adding pipes not previously included. Updates: primarily made to attributes, with emphasis on normalizing field values; Inserts: geometry (new pipes) w/ corresponding attributes Per curation strategy \u201cground rules\u201d: no geometry or attribute changes made to regionalization; EXCEPT where normalization of ownership field performed to match the ownership domain (just for Collier infrastructure) Remaining questions regarding ownership attributes; some uncertainty about whether builder, owner, or maintainer is being recorded as owner (here and elsewhere), handling joint ownership, etc. This is something that will be addressed globally in future updates. After first round of edits, ~dozen locations where clarity on pipe location was needed Clarified most of those locations with NIRA in meeting on May 1 2017. Course of action/resolutions captured in notes layer. Second round of edits proceeded based on NIRA instruction. Geometry adjustment of existing pipes made to comply with NIRA data. Geometry Geometry edited to move the sewer atlas data coincident with submission in 99% of cases. A new set of clarifications are being compiled for review where outstanding questions. Most cases did not require any adds or deletes, but just moving the nodes to match and using map topology editing to drag along the lines. Attributes: Ownership Owner field cleaned up to standardize names in the owner field for both segments and nodes. The data submission included datasets for both CTMA owned and private structures. The private structure data included information on the owners as well. The current datamodel is focued on government and authority ownership, so the owner field focused on four categories: CTMA \u2013 coincident features with the CTMA submission COLL \u2013 Collier Township owned infrastructure as indicated in the Private structure data Private \u2013 all other owners in the Private structure submission. Unknown \u2013 structures in the current data but are not present in either the CTMA or Private Structures. The owner fields were also not updated or standardized for the large trunk bisecting Collier. This was not included in the CTMA submission and the current data indicates the nodes are owned by Collier Township and the pipe by South Fayette.

Information Window The steps in this guide refer to widgets contained in the Map and Information windows. Step 1. Get to your location of interest on the map To move the map to your current location, you can use one of several methods: Method 1: Use the My Location widget \u2026when using mobile devices in the field The My Location* button will automatically map your physical location***. This is useful if you are using a mobile device in the field, and need to quickly figure out what infrastructure is nearby your location. Note: this works only if your web browser and/or device has the necessary geo-location capabilities enabled. These capabilities vary by device; tablets and smartphones typically have this capability. The web browser on your device may prompt you to allow the Sewer Atlas to access your device\u2019s location: By selecting Allow , the Atlas will shift the map to your location. Method 2: Enter the address If you have the address of complaint, you can enter it into the The Search widget , located in the upper left hand corner of the map window. In the Search Widget, enter the address as: street-number street-name, city, state (optional) zip code (optional). For example, you would enter the address for 3 Rivers Wet Weather as 3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224 Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results: Method 3: Enter the Wastewater Structure ID If the ID for the wastewater structure related to the complaint is known, such as for a manhole or outfall, you can enter that into the search bar instead of the address. The Search widget located in the upper left hand corner of the map window also allows you to enter the wastewater structure ID number . To search by ID: In the Search Widget, enter the ID number. This could include, for example: manhole IDs: MH049K010 outfall IDs: A-20Z Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results: By clicking the result in the dropdown, the map will pan and zoom to that location. Note that if you enter a partial ID number, the search will return related results: Step 2. View and Interact with Sewer Data Once you have found the location of interest, you may need to identify specific pieces of infrastructure nearby. There are a few ways to make sure the map allows you to see the infrastructure you\u2019re looking for. Wastewater Infrastructure Layers This being a sewer infrastructure atlas, the map by default shows the key elements of the regional wastewater infrastructure: pipes, structures, and virtual laterals. The map Legend in the Information Window summarizes the symbols for wastewater infrastructure features that are visible on the map. The legend will change dynamically depending on the layers shown on the map. Pipes So that you may quickly get a sense of the hierarchy of the wastewater network, the pipes are shown on the map in classes by diameter in inches as follows: Virtual Laterals Zooming in far enough on the map will reveal virtual laterals. Note that virtual laterals do not represent actual pipes, but indicate likely connections from buildings to the nearest municipal pipe. Flow Direction On both Pipes and Virtual Laterals, Arrows indicate the direction of wastewater flow. Structures Wastewater structures are points on the map, illustrated with symbols that denote general function: Structures will appear at higher zoom levels. Get information about Wastewater Infrastructure Layers The wastewater infrastructure data shown on the map has numerous informational attributes about the infrastructure. To see these attributes, simply click on a feature. A pop-up window will appear. This window contains key attributes, such as the wastewater structure ID, the X/Y coordinates, and pipe sizes, and the ALCOSAN point of connection ID. Note: coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are currently shown in the NAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272). This differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget described above Text at the very top of the window will indicate if one or more features have been selected. This will often happen if you select, for example, a manhole, which will have one or more pipes attached to it, or any other features in very close proximity to one another. Use the arrows on the top right side of the pop-up window to quickly cycle through the attributes of nearby infrastructure. Get the X/Y coordinates of a specific wastewater structure Note: currently the coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are shown in the NAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272). This differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget. While both systems are accurately used to show data on this map, a future release will provide the wastewater structure coordinates in a manner consistent with other coordinates displayed on the map To get the coordinates for a specific wastewater structure, use the coordinate display at the bottom of the map window. The coordinates are updated based on the position of the mouse over the map. To get the coordinates for a specific location (and keep them from changing when the pointer moves): click the button shown to the left of the coordinates (noted in the image above with a red arrow). click the location on the map (such as on the wastewater structure) that you need the coordinates for. The coordinates will remain until the user clicks on the map again, or toggles the button. Step 3. Trace the Sewer Network Now that you have found your location of interest and identified the sewer infrastructure you are interested in, you can begin to figure out where possible illicit discharges might be coming from by tracing the sewer network. The Network Trace widget automates this analysis for you. Open the Network Trace widget in the Information Window . Click the Flag button in the widget, and then click on the map on top of the infrastructure at the location from which you want to trace. You will likely want to place the flag directly on the manhole or other structure from which you are conducting the analysis, but the trace can run from any location on the pipe. Note that the flag you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe or structure for the analysis, so it is OK if you don\u2019t place it precisely! In the widget window, click the Trace button, and the analysis will start. Depending on how many pipes are traced, the analysis may take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two to complete. You can continue to do other things with Atlas, such as pan and zoom or turn layers on and off, while the trace analysis runs. When the analysis is complete, the results of the trace are added to the map. upstream pipes are highlighted in orange upstream structures are highlighted in orange downstream pipes are highlighted in green downstream structures structures are highlighted in green As with the wastewater structure layers, you can click on the trace results on the map to view attributes of the infrastructure. By clicking the Clear button in the widget, the network trace results and any Flag inputs will be removed from the map. Step 4. Identify sample points upstream Once you can see results of the trace on the map, you can go back and use available layers to help identify potential sample points and discharge sources. Upstream wastewater structures and pipes Once you\u2019ve completed a trace, upstream pipes and upstream structures will be shown on the map highlighted in orange. You can click on the orange pipes and orange structure to get the same pop-up information you could see without the trace, as described above. Virtual Laterals Even though Virtual laterals are not traced with the network trace widget, use them in conjunction with the orange upstream trace results as a visual reference, to help identify possible discharge sources. Virtual laterals are mapped from the center of buildings. Step 5. Printing Instead of taking screenshots to capture the current map view, using the Print widget. This widget allows you to \u201cprint\u201d your current map view direct to a .pdf file or one of several image file formats, with the added benefit of providing a complete map layout with legend, scale, and title. By default the widget will generate an 8.5 x 11 inch .pdf map. To print: simply adjust the view of the map to the view you would like to save. select The print window includes an advanced options button that allows the user to customize the map title, author, image resolution, and other details. The print job is sent to a remote server, and may take some time to complete. You can use the rest of the Atlas while waiting - the job will complete in the background and notify you when ready. Supporting Functionality The Base Map and other supplementary map data By default, imagery from Allegheny County with streets and points of interest from Esri is displayed with the wastewater network data.

Changing Map Layers Clicking the Map Layers widget displays all layers shown on the map (except for the basemap) A number of data layers are available for viewing on the map in addition to the sewer data. This includes regional flow monitoring points and their estimated catchment areas several map services provided by Allegheny County, which include geodata ranging from parcel boundaries to recent aerial imagery \u201cVirtual laterals\u201d to help identify the pipe to which a given parcel is linked in the wastewater network (note that improvements to this data is ongoing) The user can opt to turn layers and sub-layers on or off as needed by clicking the checkbox to the right of each item. Clicking the down arrow on the right side of a layer displays a context menu, which includes the following functions: Zoom to : Sets the map extent to the extent of the layer. Transparency : Sets the transparency for the layer. Move up : Moves the layer one level up. Move down : Moves the layer one level down. Open attribute table :Opens the Attribute Table for the feature layer. This allows the user to view all attributes for features, and provides some other filtering and export abilities described further below. Description / Show Item Details : Opens the service description or the item details page for the service or the item associated with the layer, if available. This page includes information for linking to the feature service or downloading a static version of the data in one of several spatial or non-spatial formats. The ability to download varies by data source. Changing Basemaps Clicking the Basemap Gallery widget displays all available basemaps. The user can optionally select the base map shown underneath the map layers. By default, this is set to a high-resolution imagery map from Allegheny County with a reference layer from Esri; however, other basemap options such as \u2018Dark Canvas\u2019 may provide the user with higher legibility and clarity, especially when printing. Note that graphically simpler basemaps tend to have smaller tile file sizes and consequently will load faster. Clicking one of the basemap thumbnails sets it as the active basemap for the application. Click the x button in the upper right corner of the Basemap Gallery window to close it. Searching for Locations The Search widget is located in the upper left hand corner of the map; it enables end users to find locations on the map. To search for locations, in the Search widget enter either: Coordinates, entered as Longitude, Latitude (i.e., X, Y ); in Allegheny County: the first coordinate will generally be between -80.36 and -79.69 . the second coordinate will generally be between 40.67 and 40.19 . Addresses (e.g., 3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224) Place Names (e.g., Pittsburgh) Wastewater Structure ID Number; this looks like, for example: manhole IDs: MH049K010 outfall IDs: A-20Z Municipalities in the ALCOSAN service area Once you\u2019ve entered the information you want to search for, Click the Search Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results. Note that for Wastewater Structure IDs, entering a partial number will return similar results: Advanced Searches By default, the Atlas will attempt to figure out what you\u2019re trying to search for, and return the relevant results. However, occassionally it won\u2019t be able to do this. In those instances, specify which database you need to search using the drop-down on the left-hand side of the search box: Specifically for street addresses, the arrow on the left side of the search box allows you to specify which service you want to search. Identifying Coordinates There are two ways to quickly identify real-world coordinates in the application: The coordinates of the location of the mouse on the map are displayed in real-time in the bottom left-hand corner of the map window. A button to the left of these values acts as a toggle; when clicked, it allows the user to click a point on the map, and see the coordinates for that point in the lower left. The coordinates will not update until the user clicks on the map again or toggles the button. The Measurement widget, located in the top right corner of the map window, provides the ability to place a temporary flag on the map. The coordinates are reported for this flag in the Measurement widget window. Note that the Sewer Atlas displays data in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxilary Sphere coordinate reference system (CRS). All coordinates reported in the application are in this CRS. Using the Attribute Table The Attribute Table displays a tabular view of the map data and its attributes at the bottom of the map window. It is a powerful tool for searching, selecting, sorting, and exporting data from the map. Please note that the wastewater network contains over 125,000 features. Certain operations conducted on the entire dataset in the Attribute Table , such as sorting, will take time to complete. Opening the table The attribute table can be opened two ways: clicking the arrow/tab at the bottom of the map window though the Map Layers widget in the information window, clicking the down arrow on the right side of a layer, which will open a context menu with an Open attribute table option. When more than one layer\u2019s attributes display, multiple tabs automatically generate in the attribute panel allowing you to switch among the attribute tables. Using the table Clicking a record in the table selects it and highlights the corresponding feature in the map with the color specified in the Attribute Table widget configuration window. Press the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple records. By Clicking a field heading , the table will sort the records by the field. Buttons at the top of table help manage the selection and the way the table displays: An Options menu provides advanced selection, filtering, and exporting options. More on this later. Zoom to selected: features\u2014Clicking Zoom to resets the map extent to center around selected features. Clear selections: \u2014Clicking the Clear Selection button clears all selections. Refresh \u2014Clicking Refresh refreshes the tables. Show or hide columns: \u2014Clicking the + icon on the right side of the Attribute Table panel opens the field visibility window. Check or uncheck the fields to set them to visible or invisible in the table. Number of selected records\u2014Shown on the lower left of the table. Can also be accessed from the Options menu. Selecting and Filtering records and features The Attribute Table provides the user to dig deep into the data and manipulate what data is shown on the map. Through the Options menu on the table, you can select or filter records in the table, which in turn highlights or filters, respectively, the corresponding features on the map. The available options Show Selected Records: Only displays selected records. By hiding records you haven\u2019t selected, it may be easier to visually browse the table. Show Related Records: Note: the Sewer Atlas does not currently have related tables. Displays related records if a selected record has related table. Filter: Allows the user to specify a query that will filter records in the table. Filter by Map Extent: This option only displays attributes in the table for features within the current map extent. Exporting records from the table The Options menu provides an Export to CSV tool, which creates a file that can be opened in Microsoft Excel, other spreadsheet software, or a text editor. If records are selected and/or a filter is applied, only the selected and/or filtered records are exported. If no records are selected or filtered, all the records are exported. Querying Features The Query widget provides a way to run predefined and custom queries to highlight specific features on the map\u2013these features can then be summarized and exported in multiple formats. Currently, two predefined queries are setup: Highlight by Point of Connection (POC) Highlight by Owner Note: these can easily be expanded/modified to meet user requirements based on available data - just ask! Selecting one of these options in the Query window will take you to an options screen, where you are presented with two options: Attribute criteria and Spatial Filter . Minimally, you need to select an attribute criterion, and leave the spatial filter set to its default option. Attribute criteria This lets you select the attribute you are looking for. For POC, this is the POC code (e.g., M-44); For Owner, it is the owner name. You can enter text\u2013it will attempt to guess what you\u2019re looking for\u2013or use the drop-down to select available values to search for. Spatial Filter (optional) This lets you pick a way to spatially filter the data returned by the selected attribute criteria. Return features within full extent of the map (Default): All features meeting attribute criteria will be returned, regardless of whether you can see them currently in the map window. Only return features within current map extent : Returns only features meeting the attribute criteria that you can see within the map window currently. Only return features that intersect with shape drawn on the map : This lets you draw a polygon on the map. Only features that meet your attribute criteria and intersect that polygon will be returned. Only return features that have a spatial relationship with features in another layer (under development): Similiar to the drawing option above, this lets you use another feature in addition to your attribute criteria to select features. The difference here is that it takes a feature you have selected from another layer. For example, you could select a sewershed in the sewersheds layer, specify that layer here, and it will be used to narrow the query results. Running and Query and Using the Results Once you\u2019ve set up the query options, hit the Execute button. A list of pipes selected in the query will appear in the info window. Clicking on one of the list items will focus the map on that pipe. At the top right of the results is a \u201c. . .\u2019 button. This provides further options for using the results. Of note: Export to CSV file: exports results as a table, for use in spreadsheet programs Export to Feature Colletion : exports results as a GeoJSON file, for use on a web map Export to Shapefile : exports results as a shapefile, which is is used in GIS and CAD software. Statistics... : Performs basic statistics (e.g., sum, average, etc.) on the queried features. By default this is performed using the length field. View in Attribute Table : Creates a view of just the queried records and select fields in the Attribute Table . Filtering Map Features See Using the Attribute Table >>> Selecting and Filtering records and features for instructions on how to filter features. Tracing the Wastewater Network The Network Trace widget allows the user to identify upstream and downstream wastewater pipes and structures from any given point. It automatically runs both upstream and downstream traces, returning connected wastewater pipes and structures in both directions. It provides a basic summary of these features along with the ability to download the complete results. Tracing from a point on the network Tracing is initiated from one (or more) Flag inputs that the user places on the map. Open the widget, click the Flag button, and select the desired location(s) on the map. Note that the location you pick does not need to be ultra-precise; the point you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe once the trace is initiated. Click Run and the trace will commence. The results of the trace are added to the map in 4 new layers: upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures. These new layers are effectively copies of the traced pipes and structures from the wastewater network dataset. Each layer is accessible in the both the Map Layers widget and the Attribute Table , and contains all attributes of the wastewater network dataset. By clicking the Clear' button, the result layers and any Flag` inputs will be removed from the map. Viewing and using tracing results The tracing results are shown in the widget window in a series of expandable tabs. The first tab provides a summary count of upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures for quick reference. The tabs that follow list pipes and structures that were traced upstream and downstream. Clicking on any item will highlight the item on the map. The results can be downloaded by clicking the download .csv button.

SemVer was originally developed for software versioning as a way to indicate major, minor, and patch changes to software. With the Sewer Atlas, we use it to indicate the nature of changes to both the schema and the data itself. The SemVer Concept The Semantic Versioning website provides a quick summary: Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. SemVer as adapted for Sewer Atlas data versioning In the context of a data versioning, we\u2019ve adapted to concept of Semver to mean the following MAJOR version : when the database schema changes e.g. 6 .2.1 If the change requires a database migration, it\u2019s a major version change. Most likely, software utilizing the database will need to be adjusted to handle the different data schema (e.g., ensuring that a web map is using the correct column in the table for renderning a label). MINOR version : when records in the database are added/updated (during a regular quarterly release cycle) e.g. 6. 2 .1 Planned changes to signifcant portions of records in the database, as is done in quarterly release cycles, represent MINOR version changes. Software utilizing the database should continue to function as it would; no changes to schema occur in a MINOR version change. PATCH version : when edits are needed to address a problem with the data e.g. 6.2. 1 Problems with the data that cannot wait for a quarterly release cycle are addressed with patch changes. The types of problems addressed with a PATCH version might include: fixing issues with geometric network connectivity (i.e., the topology of pipe network was not maintained in error, and needs to be fixed for tracing to work); incorporating timely changes to specific locations of interest to 3RWW partners between releases The semi-automated QAQC process during the quarterly release cycle (typically MINOR version changes) largely lets us identify problems between releases, which is why these types of versions are rare. SemVer and Year-Quarter release tagging We label releases with a Year-Quarter tag following a YYYY-Q*n* pattern, e.g., 2018-Q1. How does this differ from SemVer, and why do we do both? The quarterly release tag merely indicates when updated data will be or was released SemVer indicates the nature of the changes since the last version at a high level Epilogue Our use of SemVer for tagging database releases is largely experimental. Our eventual goal is evolve the \u201cstandard\u201d conveyed above into our editing post-processing toolchain, such that we can qualify changes in a semi-automated way.

It is the successor to Landbase Systems\u2019 \u201cWebMap\u201d. The Sewer Atlas is an evolving product, with plans to iteratively roll out improvements to both the web mapping application and the underlying regional sewer network data. The regional sewer network data shown on the Sewer Atlas web map is derived from the same data used in the One Overall Map: the 2011 data created by Landbase Systems for 3 Rivers Wet Weather. With the exception of an attempted update of the new regional sewer network dataset in 2014, no changes had been made to this data until August 2016. THE NEED FOR A DATA MAINTENANCE STRATEGY Currently, a number of organizations are working with regional sewer network data. The figure below describes very generally how some of these organizations are using regional sewer network data and/or contributing to it: ORGANIZATION DATA USAGE, MAINTENANCE ROLE, AND/OR SCOPE OF WORK 3 Rivers Wet Weather w/ CivicMapper Manages and maintains Sewer Atlas web mapping application (formerly \u201cLandbase Systems WebMap\u201d) and regional sewer network data (\u201cOne Overall Map\u201d) Responsible for municipal outreach, data coordination, and data maintenance Municipalities/Agencies w/ consultants Each manage and maintain local municipal sewer network data. Some municipal consultants manage the data for more than one municipality ALCOSAN Internal mapping capability to support operations ALCOSAN w/ AECOM Currently updating location and physical attributes of those sewer segments that will regionalized to support the regionalization project using existing regional data to compare/validate new data ALCOSAN w/ CDM Smith modeling flows to interceptors / points of connection using existing regional data and new data (received via AECOM) for modeling SPECIFIC NEEDS AND CONSIDERATIONS Through the work being completed by these organizations, 3RWW has noted a range of immediate needs and/or long term considerations for maintaining and improving the regional network data. These include but are not limited to: facilitating ongoing/continuous municipal updates to maintain overall data accuracy and precision, allowing for increased confidence in the results of system analysis updating missing pipe attributes as in the data to support CDM Smith\u2019s flow capacity modeling work ensuring that new field data collected by AECOM for ALCOSAN\u2019s regionalization efforts integrates with existing regional sewer network data (i.e., maintain topological connectivity of the data) from municipalities and agencies addressing the existing legacy data model from LBS\u2019 WebMap/OneOverall Map, which has fallen into disrepair, and recognizing that a NASSCO standards-compliant data model will better support long-term sewer network data maintenance efforts and modeling requirements. With multiple organizations working with and improving the accuracy and precision of regional sewer network data, there is a clear need for a coordinated, accessible data curation and maintenance strategy that will enable the efficient maintenance of regional sewer network data into the future. STRATEGY To support the continued evolution of the regional sewer network dataset, 3RWW has formalized its curation and maintenance strategy for maintaining regional sewer network data. The strategy encompasses: The four guiding principles An illustration of the logistics of data curation and maintenance, as implemented technically PRINCIPLES 1. BUILD FROM THE NEWEST DATA MODEL: AECOM\u2019S REGIONALIZATION-FOCUSED SCHEMA FROM INFONET (NASSCO STANDARDS-COMPLIANT) Retain a subset of the full data model at the regional-level, and select core attributes for which local maintenance will be expected: The InfoNet-developed, NASSCO-compliant data model created by AECOM has 160 attributes in use for Regionalization. While not all are needed for regional municipal data maintenance, the NASSCO standard will ensure that those which are needed will be properly managed to a national standard. Core attributes include the most important attributes that the Data Source Maintainers (the municipalities, agencies, and consultants working with the data) can be expected to maintain. This may be just 6-10 attributes, but must include attributes critical to modeling and risk management; metadata is also required. 2. FOCUSED, INCREMENTAL UPDATES Update with a purpose: Prioritize, scope, and focus data updates to meet clearly defined needs. For example, a single update might either: address a data gap required to support an analysis (e.g., pipe diameters) integrate a set of changes to the data based on real system change (e.g., add new pipes recently put in the ground) Leverage extensive working knowledge of other organizations working with the data (e.g., AECOM, CDM Smith) to identify where the existing data needs to be fixed the most Record the \u201cchange-set\u201d: Utilize the data versioning and archiving tools embedded in modern geospatial database technology, ensuring that the record of data change is captured simply through the process of editing Document rules and assumptions for each round of change in such a way that the documentation is part of/associated with the data change-set itself Emphasize improving overall data quality over time: Emphasize improving key data attributes and data geometry incrementally as a way to improve the data\u2019s overall accuracy and precision, which allow overall data quality improvement to be illustrated over time 3. PRO-ACTIVE COORDINATION Keep on top of changes to local and project data by pro-actively work with the Data Source Maintainers to exchange data updates. This is something 3RWW is already well-positioned to do. Keep the channels of communication open during the process in order to validate changesand ensure decisions and assumptions about the changes are agreed upon; keep it open after the process to ensure regional updates are being incorporated back into locally-maintained datasets. Provide derivative data products back to Data Source Maintainers in the formats they need (e.g., CAD, shapefile, pdf). 4. STANDARDIZED AND CENTRALLY-MAINTAINED DATA (LONG-TERM) Identify opportunities to expand the attributes for which Data Source Maintainers are responsible Ensure that maintained attributes are supporting modeling and analytical requirements of all municipalities look to state and federal analytical reporting requirements to inform data standards, and focus on completing attributes required for analysis identify required attributes, prioritize for completion Ensure that data model can transition or translate to an asset management system Provide tools for facilitating centralized data collection and maintenance by the municipalities; this could be achieved, for example, by: Implementing data upload and editing capability to an editing-focused Sewer Atlas web app, so partners could maintain data online Enabling municipalities/consultants to asynchronously edit regional data, make updates, and \u201cpush\u201d back to a central database Enabling data download/extraction functions so that regional data can easily be used for more detailed, local initiatives DATA EXCHANGE, CURATION, AND DISTRIBUTION LOGISTICS The implementation of the strategy described above can be understood as the cyclical flow of data through a three- step process 1. DATA SOURCE MAINTAINERS Data is maintained at a local or project-level by various partners: the municipalities within the ALCOSAN service area (and their consultants), ALCOSAN\u2019s consultants (e.g., CDM Smith, AECOM), and internal ALCOSAN data staff. These organizations can continue to use their data in the format and with the software they are most comfortable with. 2. CENTRALIZED INTEGRATION Data from the Data Source Maintainers is integrated into a centralized GeoStore, where it is curated, versioned, and archived in change-sets. Metadata, documentation, and assumptions about each change-set is both automated and manually linked to each change. Changes integrated into the GeoStore are validated with Data Source Maintainers during this part of the process. 3. DATA (RE)DISTRIBUTION: Curated data is distributed back to the Data Source Maintainers via standard secure web geodata endpoints, From these endpoints, the data can be consumed by other web and desktop software, such as the 3RWW Sewer Atlas web app, desktop GIS software, or CAD software. Additionally, static snapshots of the data, including extracts showing only the geodata that has changed, are generated for redistribution to the Data Source Maintainer. This process is illustrated and annotated generally in the following diagram: This process has several notable benefits: It is scalable: Any volume or scope of data change can be accommodated: whether it is all data generated from the regionalization project or just the addition of a new pipe in a single municipality, the process is the same It utilizes a well-supported software stack and common data standards: Formats for data exchange are known and standard, and the software utilized (Esri ArcGIS, Git, SQL, Box) are widely supported. It is designed to enable exchange of data with other software utilized by project partners, such as InfoNet (used by AECOM and PWSA), for example. It is based on modular components: This workflow embodies a modern micro-services and API-based approach to data management: independent data exchange processes wrap internal editing and analysis processes, forming what is called an \u201cinput/output sandwich\u201d. Data is acquired from the source without requiring or forcing a specific brand of software or adoption on Data Source Maintainers. Individual components of the process can evolve to meet any changing needs of the Data Source Maintainers, and technologies can be adapted as needed to support the overall goal of up-to-date, high quality data. DATA OUTREACH/EXCHANGE METHODS The publication of a secure, centralized regional network dataset (as with the existing One Overall Map hosted on 3RWW\u2019s Sewer Atlas) opens up the possibilities to exchange data with data source maintainers using several methods beyond simply sharing static files: Online editing. Data source maintainers \u201cmake changes\u201d (i.e., suggest changes) to the data online, which are then curated on the back-end and formally committed the master database by a data curator Offline, asynchronous editing. Data source maintainers pull down a synchronized copy of the database to their local editing environment, make changes, and then synchronize back to the main database. Submissions can then be curated on the back-end before being formally committed the master database by a data curator Static file submission. this is the current method (utilizing either e-mail exchanges or submissions via 3RWW MDS); it is also the most time consuming from a technical perspective - new data is manually integrated to the master database by the curator. A combination of these is also possible, and prudent given that not all data source maintainers might have the capability to do one or the other of these methods. The draft diagram below begins to illustrate how data might be updated using these workflows. REGIONALIZATION DATA EXCHANGE For the ALCOSAN Regionalization project specifically: * AECOM SendFile * ArcGIS Online, via a group, if possible DATA CURATION AND INTEGRATION The act of data curation itself is the key piece to the overall data maintenance and curation strategy, as it ensures that new data is maintained to standards and that the chain of decision-making regarding data change is maintained within the data and metadata. Data curation is broken into 3 steps: Data Submission Tracking: at a high-level, tracking simply who, what, and when data was submitted by Data Source Maintainers Data Evaluation: comparing the adherence of submitted data to both the existing data standards and existing records; this evaluation serves to guide the effort of data integration and additional data outreach efforts Data Integration: the act of incorporating submitted data into the existing data, informed by the results of the evaluation DATA SUBMISSION TRACKING To facilitate ongoing data maintenance in cooperation with Data Source Maintainers, it is necessary to track who, what, and when data was submitted for integration into the regional database. In a sense, this is the \u201cSewer Atlas CRM\u201d. It will be comprised of two related objects: Table This table will be separate from the regional sewer network data (the pipes, structures, and other infrastructure- specific domains). The table will include: Owner name (from data model Owner domain) Date of Submission/Transfer Submitter (person) Submission Scope - simple descriptive note from submitter describing nature of data submitted (e.g. \u201csupplemental to previous submission\u201d) Submitted File List Data Extents/geography (e.g., municipal or authority boundary) This table will also be used to track status of curation and integration of the submitted data into the regional sewer network dataset: Data Evaluation Summary Curation/Integration Status Evaluation report (file) This information will be opened up to partners to ensure that data curation is coordinated and consistently tracked. It will be accessible as both a table and a map. DATA EVALUATION Data submitted by Data Source Maintainers for inclusion in the regional sewer network dataset will be evaluated by 3RWW against an established, authoritative data model: AECOM\u2019s InfoNET Data Dictionary (\u201cData Model\u201d), which employs a NASSCO-compliant schema. By evaluating existing and future data submissions against the Data Model, adapting that data to the Data Model, and providing it back to the agencies, 3RWW will: enable maintenance of a datasets that are both NASSCO-compliant and consistent with the Data Model across the region, provide a data model that that can be used as a rudimentary asset information system for agencies that do not have access to such a system; and, ensure that NASSCO-compliant data is available to facilitate compliance reporting, system-wide. EVALUATION PROCESS Submitted data will be evaluated against the Data Model, focusing on the following general criteria: Feature Inventory: new or missing database records, tables, fields, domains, and network topology classes Attribute Completeness: which attributes are complete or incomplete, which are consistently utilized; emphasis on completeness of required/key fields Schema Comparison: check for matches to the Data Model of fields, field types, and field domains; Feature Comparison (geo): check for changes in the geography of each record; can detect changes made to the data topology (e.g., resulting from corrections made in database due to acquisition of higher resolution GPS information), and/or actual changes to the infrastructure (e.g., addition, rerouting, removal of pipes in the real world) Feature Comparison (attributes): check for changes in attributes of each record; used primarily to detect updates to infrastructure (e.g., a pipe segment replaced with one of new material and new width), but also used to detect improvements made to the database (e.g., correction of attribute values with domains ); only possible if schema matches and is enforced between data submitted and data model. Metadata Completeness: check for metadata for datasets Once data is received, it will be transformed into a working format on which evaluation tools (via ArcGIS data reviewer extension) can be run. Analyses will be run to address the evaluation criteria described above. The results of the evaluation will be summarized on an agency-by-agency basis. A qualitative summary, summary tables, and data comparison maps can be provided to summarize the evaluation. The results of the evaluation will inform how data is integrated back into the overall regional network dataset. The following diagram indicates the workflow from receipt of data from one data source maintainer to integration of changes back into the source database. PRO-ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT DURING DATA CURATION AND INTEGRATION Key to the data curation and integration process is proactive engagement with the data source maintainers. Ongoing decentralized data maintenance work requires ongoing engagement in order to maintain momentum and keep data up to date and up to standard. Though proactive engagement, the data source maintainers can help validate changes and ensure decisions and assumptions about the changes are agreed upon. This will ultimately support the maintenance of local datasets that mirror the standard set by the regional dataset. DATA INTEGRATION (EDITING) After an evaluation (if possible/as needed), the work of integrating the submission from the data source maintainer will proceed. New submissions from data source maintainers do not necessitate starting from scratch for the data\u2019s extents. The work of data integration will always start from the latest available version of the established regional sewer network dataset. The data integration and editing process will focus on updating records in the existing table with the geometry and attributes of the submission for the source maintainer, and/or adding new records where there is new infrastructure (or where previously undocumented infrastructure has been included). Existing records will not be deleted and replaced with new records; existing records will be updated to reflect the submission. This work can most reliably be performed manually, supported by the result of the data evaluation and/or a data conflation analysis. The wholesale clipping-out of existing data for the insertion of newly received data is to be avoided. Given the past experiences maintaining the One Overall Map and rebuilding the regional network for the Regionalization project, such a remove-and-replace approach leads to serious difficulties in reconciling new with old data. Importantly, such an approach eliminates the benefit of automatic, record-level edit tracking. CONFLICT AVOIDANCE TECHNIQUES Key to the data curation and integration process is proactive engagement with the data source maintainers. Ongoing decentralized data maintenance work requires ongoing engagement in order to maintain momentum and keep data up to date and up to standard. Though proactive engagement, the data source maintainers can help validate changes and ensure decisions and assumptions about the changes are agreed upon. This will ultimately support the maintenance of local datasets that mirror the standard set by the regional dataset. At a more granular level, data conflict editing avoidance might be achieved by the identification of infrastructure on and/or off-limits before editing and curation begins: In general, the technique is to defer to the authority on the dataset Communication is key: for an area of active work (e.g., modifying regionalization extents in a single municipality, in which changes might occur daily), wait on the authority to complete work before integration into One Overall Map / Sewer Atlas. For areas of \u201cpassive\u201d work, or where updates come in chunks, then coordination can happen as needed. In integrating any given municipal data submission, avoid infrastructure that is part of the ALCOSAN Regionalization project, plus 1 or 2 links of the network upstream, since that data is being actively managed and refined separately Notes on Virtual Nodes InfoNet, used by PWSA and AECOM for the RI project, includes virtual nodes for laterals and tie-ins to storm systems. One Overall Map also has virtual nodes, generated through the creation of the geometric network topology. Municipalities tend not to maintain this data, but it is needed for modeling. It\u2019s considered a data by-product where it doesn\u2019t represent an actual sewer structure structure. CHANGE MANAGEMENT The master database is a standard multi-user, versioned, archive-enabled RDBMS enterprise geodatabase. To manage change at the resolutions required for both maintainers and consumers of the data, there are three levels of change tracking. 1. Record-level edit tracking Edits made to each record will be tracked by the user (automatically via database authentication) and by time (automatically). This ensures the ability to track all changes to any given record, throughout the record\u2019s lifecycle. 2. Commits As baskets of work are completed (e.g., completion of edits for a related to a specific submission from a data- source maintainer), edits will be committed to the database. Each commit will be accompanied by concise, human-readable message-to continue with the CRM analogy, the \u201ccall history\u201d component-that captures the nature of all the edits: where and what the editing effort focused on, why edits were made where they were made, any lingering questions or follow up required. 3. Releases (dataset level-versioning) Regular snapshots of the master database will capture batches of commits as a Release. Release are versions of dataset ready for end-user consumption. The creation of each release will be automatically pushed to endpoints for consumption in GIS and web mapping applications, and static file download. This includes (but is not limited to): * ArcGIS Server Feature Services (vector data) * File Geodatabase (topology/geometric network-enabled) and shapefiles for static file download * Pre-rendered ArcGIS Server Tile Map Service (raster tiles, for Sewer Atlas cartography) Each release will also come with Release Notes. This will in include a high level summary of what changed from the previous release. The full record of commit messages (from #2 above) will be referenced in these notes. SHORT AND LONG-TERM DATA STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT The primary goal for short and long term data storage management is to ensure that the master database and the infrastructure on which it is hosted: can be portable, in terms of ownership and infrastructure (local or cloud); supports a wide array of end uses, via open data standards that do not limit use to a single piece of software; and, is secured. Currently, 3RWW\u2019s core database is hosted and served with a combination of Esri ArcGIS Enterpise (formerly called ArcGIS Server) and ArcGIS Online software, backed by a standard RDBMS enterprise geodatabase. Derived data products are hosted on a combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Enterprise, and 3RWW Municipal Data Support web sites, depending on use and access/sharing requirements. IMPLEMENTATION // TEST CASES 3RWW began implementing this strategy with 2015\u2019s transition to the Sewer Atlas, and has successfully demonstrated its applicability and potential through test cases, descriptions of which are included on the following pages. TEST CASE A: SYSTEM-WIDE ATTRIBUTE UPDATE EXAMPLE (PIPE DIAMETER) Test Case A illustrates how a single attribute would be updated from multiple provider data sources across the entire regional network dataset. This update serves as a successful test case and model for managing the logistics of updates to the regional sewer network data. GOALS In July and August 2016, 3RWW, ALCOSAN, AECOM, CDM Smith, and CivicMapper successfully coordinated an incremental update to the regional sewer network dataset. This goal of this test update was to complete network-wide pipe diameter attributes to support CDM Smith\u2019s flow capacity modeling work. The update process entailed: Sharing new municipal sewer datasets acquired for the regionalization project (by AECOM on behalf of ALCOSAN) with 3RWW/CivicMapper and CDM Smith Reviewing new datasets to confirm content, data age, source, extent, positional accuracy, etc. Identifying where pipe diameter information could or could not be derived from the new municipal datasets Defining and applying assumptions for the assignment of diameter data in areas where complete pipe diameter data was not available in the new datasets, based on engineering judgement and best practices, and keeping record of where the assumptions were applied Performing and documenting the update using available tools Defining the channels for distributing the revised regional sewer network data RESULTS / LESSONS CDM and CivicMapper coordinated the update; the work of updating the dataset was completed within one week. This test case demonstrates that: * quick data update turnarounds are easily within reach when the need is clearly defined, allowing time and effort to be focused (in this case, the focus was on just the pipe diameter attribute) * incremental updates can be completed concurrently with larger data update efforts, without affecting localized data updates: * e.g., This update did not, for example, include the pipe attribute and location updates made by AECOM for the ongoing regionalization project, as those updates were not yet ready for distribution (and were not provided). However, when that data is ready, it can easily be integrated. * the use of similar tools by the source data maintainers (municipalities/consultants working within the Girty\u2019s Run sewersheds are using the same tools 3RWW/CivicMapper are using) makes updates to the regional dataset work smoothly Importantly, this update process validated 3RWW and CivicMapper\u2019s curation-based approach to data maintenance for regional sewer network data. TEST CASE B: DATA SUBMISSION EVALUATION (SWISSVALE) Test Case B illustrates how the evaluation criteria would be applied process for a data submission from a provider to support integrating it with the regional network dataset. GOALS In December 2016, CivicMapper and AECOM coordinated an initial exchange or regional sewer network data in order to test the Data Evaluation methodology (p. 7). The goal of this test case was to demonstrate how evaluation criteria could be applied to assess a submission from a single data source maintainer for integration into the regional sewer network database. The test only involved conducting the evaluation, not integrating the data. RESULTS AECOM received data from Swissvale Borough in response to their request for files showing asset to be included in the Regionalization effort. Swissvale also included data for the entire system of 772 pipes and 646 nodes. This data was analyzed based on several characteristics to determine its fitness for inclusion in the regional network dataset update process. The geometric analysis of the linear features shows good matching with about 10% changes detected for a combination of add, removes and spatial updates. Using a set of key field for pipes and nodes derived from the InfoNET data exchange data dictionary, the analysis shows that most key fields are both available and fairly complete for key fields but the data is lacking in completeness of fields that would provide data confidence, including feature update date fields, feature location method, feature accuracy. LESSONS The Swissvale data as submitted was not provided in a database with enforced schema and as expected did not match the AECOM/InfoNet data model, which makes an evaluation based on comparison impossible-at least in a way that can be consistently and efficiently performed. This is expected to be the case for most data submissions until some momentum around ongoing data maintenance can be built among data source maintainers. Two lessons can be learned from this test case: The time spent to load and transform a custom database, clean it up enough for evaluation, and generate custom reporting reflective of the custom data model could also be better spent simply doing the work of the curation/update/integration. Through that process, the documentation of the changes made, along automatic data versioning and metadata generation, can provide the paper trail and rationale needed to support consistent integration of that data source maintainer\u2019s datasets in the future-at least until they adopt the regional data model. Long-term, there is a clear need for proactive engagement before, during, and after the curation process, to help build a case for the the data source maintainers to move to the regional data model-or at the very least, adopt some of the standards of the data model (e.g., domains for key fields).","title":"Sewer Atlas Data Curation and Maintenance Strategy"},{"location":"strategy/#sewer-atlas-data-curation-and-maintenance-strategy","text":"Updated 21 December 2018","title":"Sewer Atlas Data Curation and Maintenance Strategy"},{"location":"strategy/#background","text":"3 Rivers Wet Weather (3RWW) hosts the Sewer Atlas, a web map for the visualization of and interaction with regional sewer network data in the ALCOSAN service area.

The wholesale clipping-out of existing data for the insertion of newly received data is to be avoided. Given the past experiences maintaining the One Overall Map and rebuilding the regional network for the Regionalization project, such a remove-and-replace approach leads to serious difficulties in reconciling new with old data. Importantly, such an approach eliminates the benefit of automatic, record-level edit tracking.","title":"DATA INTEGRATION (EDITING)"},{"location":"strategy/#conflict-avoidance-techniques","text":"Key to the data curation and integration process is proactive engagement with the data source maintainers. Ongoing decentralized data maintenance work requires ongoing engagement in order to maintain momentum and keep data up to date and up to standard. Though proactive engagement, the data source maintainers can help validate changes and ensure decisions and assumptions about the changes are agreed upon. This will ultimately support the maintenance of local datasets that mirror the standard set by the regional dataset. At a more granular level, data conflict editing avoidance might be achieved by the identification of infrastructure on and/or off-limits before editing and curation begins: In general, the technique is to defer to the authority on the dataset Communication is key: for an area of active work (e.g., modifying regionalization extents in a single municipality, in which changes might occur daily), wait on the authority to complete work before integration into One Overall Map / Sewer Atlas. For areas of \u201cpassive\u201d work, or where updates come in chunks, then coordination can happen as needed. In integrating any given municipal data submission, avoid infrastructure that is part of the ALCOSAN Regionalization project, plus 1 or 2 links of the network upstream, since that data is being actively managed and refined separately Notes on Virtual Nodes InfoNet, used by PWSA and AECOM for the RI project, includes virtual nodes for laterals and tie-ins to storm systems. One Overall Map also has virtual nodes, generated through the creation of the geometric network topology. Municipalities tend not to maintain this data, but it is needed for modeling.

The update process entailed: Sharing new municipal sewer datasets acquired for the regionalization project (by AECOM on behalf of ALCOSAN) with 3RWW/CivicMapper and CDM Smith Reviewing new datasets to confirm content, data age, source, extent, positional accuracy, etc. Identifying where pipe diameter information could or could not be derived from the new municipal datasets Defining and applying assumptions for the assignment of diameter data in areas where complete pipe diameter data was not available in the new datasets, based on engineering judgement and best practices, and keeping record of where the assumptions were applied Performing and documenting the update using available tools Defining the channels for distributing the revised regional sewer network data","title":"GOALS"},{"location":"strategy/#results-lessons","text":"CDM and CivicMapper coordinated the update; the work of updating the dataset was completed within one week. This test case demonstrates that: * quick data update turnarounds are easily within reach when the need is clearly defined, allowing time and effort to be focused (in this case, the focus was on just the pipe diameter attribute) * incremental updates can be completed concurrently with larger data update efforts, without affecting localized data updates: * e.g., This update did not, for example, include the pipe attribute and location updates made by AECOM for the ongoing regionalization project, as those updates were not yet ready for distribution (and were not provided). However, when that data is ready, it can easily be integrated. * the use of similar tools by the source data maintainers (municipalities/consultants working within the Girty\u2019s Run sewersheds are using the same tools 3RWW/CivicMapper are using) makes updates to the regional dataset work smoothly Importantly, this update process validated 3RWW and CivicMapper\u2019s curation-based approach to data maintenance for regional sewer network data.","title":"RESULTS / LESSONS"},{"location":"strategy/#test-case-b-data-submission-evaluation-swissvale","text":"Test Case B illustrates how the evaluation criteria would be applied process for a data submission from a provider to support integrating it with the regional network dataset.","title":"TEST CASE B: DATA SUBMISSION EVALUATION (SWISSVALE)"},{"location":"strategy/#goals_1","text":"In December 2016, CivicMapper and AECOM coordinated an initial exchange or regional sewer network data in order to test the Data Evaluation methodology (p. 7).

Swissvale also included data for the entire system of 772 pipes and 646 nodes. This data was analyzed based on several characteristics to determine its fitness for inclusion in the regional network dataset update process. The geometric analysis of the linear features shows good matching with about 10% changes detected for a combination of add, removes and spatial updates. Using a set of key field for pipes and nodes derived from the InfoNET data exchange data dictionary, the analysis shows that most key fields are both available and fairly complete for key fields but the data is lacking in completeness of fields that would provide data confidence, including feature update date fields, feature location method, feature accuracy.","title":"RESULTS"},{"location":"strategy/#lessons","text":"The Swissvale data as submitted was not provided in a database with enforced schema and as expected did not match the AECOM/InfoNet data model, which makes an evaluation based on comparison impossible-at least in a way that can be consistently and efficiently performed. This is expected to be the case for most data submissions until some momentum around ongoing data maintenance can be built among data source maintainers. Two lessons can be learned from this test case: The time spent to load and transform a custom database, clean it up enough for evaluation, and generate custom reporting reflective of the custom data model could also be better spent simply doing the work of the curation/update/integration. Through that process, the documentation of the changes made, along automatic data versioning and metadata generation, can provide the paper trail and rationale needed to support consistent integration of that data source maintainer\u2019s datasets in the future-at least until they adopt the regional data model. Long-term, there is a clear need for proactive engagement before, during, and after the curation process, to help build a case for the the data source maintainers to move to the regional data model-or at the very least, adopt some of the standards of the data model (e.g., domains for key fields).","title":"LESSONS"}]}
