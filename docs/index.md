## Atlas Documentation

The **3 Rivers Wet Weather Atlas** represents the next generation of mapping products from [3 Rivers Wet Weather (3RWW) ](www.3riverswetweather.org). Developed by [CivicMapper](http://www.civicmapper.com), the Atlas has consolidated previous 3RWW geodata and maps into one geographic information system (GIS).

The Atlas is currently in active development, with improvements to the applications and data being made on regular basis. This page lists all Atlas products. The menus at the top of the page provide links to the documentation and other resources for select applications.

## [3RWW Sewer Atlas](http://mds.3riverswetweather.org/atlas/rsi)

The Sewer Atlas is a custom Esri-powered web application hosted by 3RWW that provides full interactivity with regional sewer infrastructure data, including network tracing.

| Resource | Link |
| --- | --- |
| [Sewer Atlas](http://mds.3riverswetweather.org/atlas/rsi) | The primary map; provides full interactivity with regional sewer infrastructure data, including network tracing. |
| [Help Documentation](help_rsi.md) | General help documentation for the Sewer Atlas. Workflow-specific guides are also available. |
| [November 2015 Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO1S4CFOxdI) | A live overview of the functionality of the Sewer Atlas, with Q/A from users. |
| [Data Changelog](changelog.md) | An ongoing summary of general changes made to the data behind the Sewer Atlas (starting with 2017 updates)  |

## [3RWW Green Infrastructure Atlas](http://www.3riverswetweather.org/green/green-infrastructure-atlas)

The 3RWW Green Infrastructure Atlas is a set of ArcGIS Online web applications that provides interactivity with 3RWW's regional green infrastructure data. This includes location-based querying and the creation of graphic data summaries using available data.

Data editing tools are available for internal use. As the data and data model is improved, additional querying and summary tools will be implemented.

| Resource | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Viewer Map](http://www.3riverswetweather.org/green/green-infrastructure-atlas) | Basic interactivity with 3RWW's regional green infrastructure data. This includes location-based querying and the creation of graphic data summaries using available data. |
| [Public Submission Form](https://3rww.maps.arcgis.com/apps/GeoForm/index.html?appid=5e4b4d640139467a832749a44be9678c) | A form for submitting green infrastructure projects to 3RWW. Submitted projects are curated by 3RWW before being published to the Viewer Map. |
| [Internal Data Entry Form](https://3rww.maps.arcgis.com/apps/GeoForm/index.html?appid=83040b9492844001b572136401aa888b) | An extended data entry form for adding green infrastructure projects into the main dataset. *For internal use only (requires 3RWW AGOL authorization).* |
| [Internal Data Editing Map](https://3rww.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=44c523ae9a294ea7a3cfef81958deeeb) | An map with full data editing capabilities active on the main dataset. Used for data curation. *For internal use only (requires 3RWW AGOL authorization).* |

## [3RWW Open Data](http://data-3rww.opendata.arcgis.com/)

We make a number of dataset openly available through our ArcGIS Online Open Data Portal at <http://data-3rww.opendata.arcgis.com>. There, you'll find:

* SUSTAIN: Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) suitability modeling results for Allegheny County, PA.
* Green Infrastructure: the data the powers the Green Infrastructure Atlas
* Rainfall: A Rain Gauge dataset that provides access to our Datawise Rainfall API.

The open data site provides the ability to download interactively explore data on web maps, as well as download it in multiple formats. 

## Other Mapping Resources and Analytical Tools

Several other existing map-based analysis tools provided by 3 Rivers Wet Weather are planned to be updated and integrated within the Atlas as data, geoprocessing, and/or map services:

* **[Calibrated Radar Rainfall Data](http://www.3riverswetweather.org/municipalities/calibrated-radar-rainfall-data):** online; new version planned
* **[Engineer's / Planner's Tool](http://www.3riverswetweather.org/green-infrastructure):** online; updated version planned
* **[Property Owner's Tool](http://www.3riverswetweather.org/green/homeowners-tool):** online; updated version planned
