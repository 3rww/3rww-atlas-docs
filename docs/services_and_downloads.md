# Sewer Atlas Data Downloads and Services

*Note: The Sewer Atlas' composite regional wastewater infrastructure dataset is not publicly available. If you would like to request access to this data, please contact [Beth Dutton @ 3 Rivers Wet Weather](mailto:bdutton@3rww.org).*

## Downloads

For registered 3RWW MDS users, all Sewer Atlas data is available for download in multiple GIS formats on the [MDS Downloads page](http://mds.3riverswetweather.org/downloads.aspx). This includes:

* Geopackage
* Open FileGDB-spec file geodatabase (includes a geometric network class that supports tracing in Esri ArcGIS Desktop)
* Esri Shapefile

Additionaly, two map packages (`.mpk`) files for ArcGIS Desktop are available: 

* data embedded (as file geodatabase) and symbolized
* data linked to the live ArcGIS Server endpoints (same as used by the Sewer Atlas)

(Need another format? Let us know at [3rww@civicmapper.com](mailto:3rww@civicmapper.com))

## Web Services

Web geodata services endpoints&mdash;links to the live data through OGC-compliant service endpoints&mdash;are currently not available, but we plan to make those available in the future through integration with 3RWW's MDS Single Sign-On system.
