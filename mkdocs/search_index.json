This includes\n\n\n\n\nregional flow monitoring points and their estimated catchment areas\n\n\nseveral map services provided by Allegheny County, which include geodata ranging from parcel boundaries to recent aerial imagery\n\n\n\u201cVirtual laterals\u201d to help identify the pipe to which a given parcel is linked in the wastewater network (note that improvements to this data is ongoing)\n\n\n\n\nThe user can opt to turn layers and sub-layers on or off as needed by clicking the \ncheckbox\n to the right of each item.\n\n\nClicking the \ndown arrow\n on the right side of a layer displays a context menu, which includes the following functions:\n\n\n\n\nZoom to\n: Sets the map extent to the extent of the layer.\n\n\nTransparency\n: Sets the transparency for the layer.\n\n\nMove up\n: Moves the layer one level up.\n\n\nMove down\n: Moves the layer one level down.\n\n\nOpen attribute table\n:Opens the \nAttribute Table\n for the feature layer. This allows the user to view all attributes for features, and provides some other filtering and export abilities described further below.\n\n\nDescription / Show Item Details\n: Opens the service description or the item details page for the service or the item associated with the layer, if available. This page includes information for linking to the feature service or downloading a static version of the data in one of several spatial or non-spatial formats. The ability to download varies by data source.\n\n\n\n\nChanging Basemaps\n\n\nClicking the \nBasemap Gallery\n widget displays all available basemaps.\n\n\nThe user can optionally select the base map shown underneath the map layers. By default, this is set to a high-resolution imagery map from Allegheny County with a reference layer from Esri; however, other basemap options such as \u2018Dark Canvas\u2019 may provide the user with higher legibility and clarity, especially when printing.\n\n\nNote that graphically simpler basemaps tend to have smaller tile file sizes and consequently will load faster.\n\n\nClicking one of the basemap thumbnails sets it as the active basemap for the application. Click the \nx\n button in the upper right corner of the Basemap Gallery window to close it.\n\n\nSearching for Locations\n\n\nThe Search widget is located in the upper left hand corner of the map; it enables end users to find locations on the map.\n\n\nTo search for locations, in the Search widget enter either:\n\n\n\n\nCoordinates, entered as Longitude, Latitude (i.e., \nX, Y\n); in Allegheny County:\n\n\nthe first coordinate will generally be between \n-80.36\n and \n-79.69\n.\n\n\nthe second coordinate will generally be between \n40.67\n and \n40.19\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddresses (e.g., 3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224)\n\n\nPlace Names (e.g., Pittsburgh)\n\n\nWastewater Structure ID Number; this looks like, for example:\n\n\nmanhole IDs: \nMH049K010\n\n\noutfall IDs: \nA-20Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMunicipalities in the ALCOSAN service area\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve entered the information you want to search for, Click the \nSearch\n Button (the magnifying glass icon). A dropdown will appear with search results.\n\n\n\n\nNote that for Wastewater Structure IDs, entering a partial number will return similar results:\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Searches\n\n\nBy default, the Atlas will attempt to figure out what you\u2019re trying to search for, and return the relevant results. However, occassionally it won\u2019t be able to do this. In those instances, specify which database you need to search using the drop-down on the left-hand side of the search box:\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically for street addresses, the arrow on the left side of the search box allows you to specify which service you want to search.\n\n\nIdentifying Coordinates\n\n\nThere are two ways to quickly identify real-world coordinates in the application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coordinates of the location of the mouse on the map are displayed in real-time in the bottom left-hand corner of the map window. A button to the left of these values acts as a toggle; when clicked, it allows the user to click a point on the map, and see the coordinates for that point in the lower left. The coordinates will not update until the user clicks on the map again or toggles the button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMeasurement\n widget, located in the top right corner of the map window, provides the ability to place a temporary flag on the map. The coordinates are reported for this flag in the Measurement widget window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Sewer Atlas displays data in the WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxilary Sphere coordinate reference system (CRS). All coordinates reported in the application are in this CRS.\n\n\nUsing the Attribute Table\n\n\nThe \nAttribute Table\n displays a tabular view of the map data and its attributes at the bottom of the map window. It is a powerful tool for searching, selecting, sorting, and exporting data from the map.\n\n\nPlease note that the wastewater network contains over 125,000 features. Certain operations conducted on the entire dataset in the \nAttribute Table\n, such as sorting, will take time to complete.\n\n\nOpening the table\n\n\nThe attribute table can be opened two ways:\n\n\n\n\nclicking the arrow/tab at the bottom of the map window\n\n\nthough the \nMap Layers\n widget in the information window, clicking the down arrow on the right side of a layer, which will open a context menu with an \nOpen attribute table\n option.\n\n\n\n\nWhen more than one layer\u2019s attributes display, multiple tabs automatically generate in the attribute panel allowing you to switch among the attribute tables.\n\n\nUsing the table\n\n\nClicking a record\n in the table selects it and highlights the corresponding feature in the map with the color specified in the Attribute Table widget configuration window. Press the Shift or Ctrl key to select multiple records.\n\n\nBy \nClicking a field heading\n, the table will sort the records by the field.\n\n\nButtons at the top of table help manage the selection and the way the table displays:\n\n\n\n\nAn \nOptions\n menu provides advanced selection, filtering, and exporting options. More on this later.\n\n\nZoom to selected:\n features\u2014Clicking Zoom to resets the map extent to center around selected features.\n\n\nClear selections:\n\u2014Clicking the Clear Selection button clears all selections.\n\n\nRefresh\n\u2014Clicking Refresh refreshes the tables.\n\n\nShow or hide columns:\n\u2014Clicking the \n+\n icon on the right side of the Attribute Table panel opens the field visibility window. Check or uncheck the fields to set them to visible or invisible in the table.\nNumber of selected records\u2014Shown on the lower left of the table. Can also be accessed from the \nOptions\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Filtering records and features\n\n\nThe Attribute Table provides the user to dig deep into the data and manipulate what data is shown on the map. Through the \nOptions menu\n on the table, you can select or filter records in the table, which in turn highlights or filters, respectively, the corresponding features on the map. The available options\n\n\n\n\nShow Selected Records:\n Only displays selected records. By hiding records you haven\u2019t selected, it may be easier to visually browse the table.\n\n\nShow Related Records:\n \nNote: the Sewer Atlas does not currently have related tables.\n Displays related records if a selected record has related table.\n\n\nFilter:\n Allows the user to specify a query that will filter records in the table.\n\n\nFilter by Map Extent:\n This option only displays attributes in the table for features within the current map extent.\n\n\n\n\nExporting records from the table\n\n\nThe \nOptions menu\n provides an \nExport to CSV\n tool, which creates a file that can be opened in Microsoft Excel, other spreadsheet software, or a text editor.\n\n\nIf records are selected and/or a filter is applied, only the selected and/or filtered records are exported. If no records are selected or filtered, all the records are exported.\n\n\nQuerying Features\n\n\nThe \nQuery\n widget provides a way to run predefined and custom queries to highlight specific features on the map\u2013these features can then be summarized and exported in multiple formats.\n\n\nCurrently, two predefined queries are setup:\n\n\n\n\nHighlight by Point of Connection (POC)\n\n\nHighlight by Owner\n\n\n\n\nNote: these can easily be expanded/modified to meet user requirements based on available data - just ask!\n\n\nSelecting one of these options in the Query window will take you to an  options screen, where you are presented with two options: \nAttribute criteria\n and \nSpatial Filter\n. Minimally, you need to select an attribute criterion, and leave the spatial filter set to its default option.\n\n\n\n\nAttribute criteria\n\n\nThis lets you select the attribute you are looking for. For POC, this is the POC code (e.g., M-44); For Owner, it is the owner name.\n\n\nYou can enter text\u2013it will attempt to guess what you\u2019re looking for\u2013or use the drop-down to select available values to search for.\n\n\nSpatial Filter (optional)\n\n\nThis lets you pick a way to spatially filter the data returned by the selected attribute criteria.\n\n\n\n\nReturn features within full extent of the map\n (Default): All features meeting attribute criteria will be returned, regardless of whether you can see them currently in the map window.\n\n\nOnly return features within current map extent\n: Returns only features meeting the attribute criteria that you can see within the map window currently. \n\n\n\n\nOnly return features that intersect with shape drawn on the map\n: This lets you draw a polygon on the map. Only features that meet your attribute criteria and intersect that polygon will be returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly return features that have a spatial relationship with features in another layer\n (under development): Similiar to the drawing option above, this lets you use another feature in addition to your attribute criteria to select features. The difference here is that it takes a feature you have selected from another layer. For example, you could select a sewershed in the sewersheds layer, specify that layer here, and it will be used to narrow the query results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning and Query and Using the Results\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set up the query options, hit the \nExecute\n button.\n\n\n\n\nA list of pipes selected in the query will appear in the info window. Clicking on one of the list items will focus the map on that pipe.\n\n\nAt the top right of the results is a \u201c. . .\u2019 button. This provides further options for using the results. Of note:\n\n\n\n\nExport to CSV\n file: exports results as a table, for use in spreadsheet programs\n\n\nExport to Feature Colletion\n: exports results as a \nGeoJSON\n file, for use on a web map\n\n\nExport to Shapefile\n: exports results as a shapefile, which is is used\nin GIS and CAD software.\n\n\nStatistics...\n: Performs basic statistics (e.g., sum, average, etc.) on the queried features. By default this is performed using the \nlength\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView in Attribute Table\n: Creates a view of just the queried records and select fields in the \nAttribute Table\n.\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Map Features\n\n\nSee \nUsing the Attribute Table >>> Selecting and Filtering records and features\n for instructions on how to filter features.\n\n\nTracing the Wastewater Network\n\n\nThe \nNetwork Trace\n widget allows the user to identify upstream and downstream wastewater pipes and structures from any given point. It automatically runs both upstream and downstream traces, returning connected wastewater pipes and structures in both directions. It provides a basic summary of these features along with the ability to download the complete results.\n\n\nTracing from a point on the network\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracing is initiated from one (or more) \nFlag\n inputs that the user places on the map. Open the widget, click the \nFlag\n button, and select the desired location(s) on the map. Note that the location you pick does not need to be ultra-precise; the point you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe once the trace is initiated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nRun\n and the trace will commence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the trace are added to the map in 4 new layers: upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures. These new layers are effectively copies of the traced pipes and structures from the wastewater network dataset. Each layer is accessible in the both the \nMap Layers\n widget and the \nAttribute Table\n, and contains all attributes of the wastewater network dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking the \nClear' button, the result layers and any\nFlag` inputs will be removed from the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing and using tracing results\n\n\nThe tracing results are shown in the widget window in a series of expandable tabs. The first tab provides a summary count of upstream pipes, upstream structures, downstream pipes, and downstream structures for quick reference. The tabs that follow list pipes and structures that were traced upstream and downstream. Clicking on any item will highlight the item on the map.\n\n\nThe results can be downloaded by clicking the \ndownload .csv\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis documentation draws heavily from ArcGIS Online documentation: \nOverview-Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS - Create Apps - Widget Overview\n.

With this guide, users will learn to:\n\n\n\n\nfind the location of interest on the map\n\n\nidentify wastewater infrastructure on the map\n\n\ntrace upstream from the nearest infrastructure\n\n\nuse available reference map layers to help identify potential discharge sources\n\n\n\n\nThe Atlas Interface\n\n\nThe Atlas is comprised of two parts:\n\n\nMap Window\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Map Window, see the complete \nhelp documentation\n.\n\n\nInformation Window\n\n\n\n\nThe steps in this guide refer to widgets contained in the Map and Information windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Get to your location of interest on the map\n\n\nTo move the map to your current location, you can use one of several methods:\n\n\nMethod 1: Use the \nMy Location\n widget\n\n\n\u2026when using mobile devices in the field\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMy Location\n button will automatically map \nyour physical location\n. This is useful if you are using a mobile device in the field, and need to quickly figure out what infrastructure is nearby your location.\n\n\nNote: this works only if your web  browser and/or device has the necessary geo-location capabilities enabled. These capabilities vary by device; tablets and smartphones typically have this capability. The web browser on your device may prompt you to allow the Sewer Atlas to access your device\u2019s location:\n\n\n\n\nBy selecting \nAllow\n, the Atlas will shift the map to your location.\n\n\nMethod 2: Enter the address\n\n\nIf you have the address of complaint, you can enter it into the The \nSearch widget\n, located in the upper left hand corner of the map window.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Search Widget, enter the address as: \nstreet-number street-name, city, state (optional) zip code (optional).\n\n\nFor example, you would enter the address for 3 Rivers Wet Weather as \n3901 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15224\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nSearch\n Button (the magnifying glass icon).\n\n\n\n\nA dropdown will appear with search results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 3: Enter the Wastewater Structure ID\n\n\nIf the ID for the wastewater structure related to the complaint is known, such as for a manhole or outfall, you can enter that into the search bar instead of the address.\n\n\nThe \nSearch widget\n located in the upper left hand corner of the map window also allows you to enter the \nwastewater structure ID number\n. To search by ID:\n\n\n\n\nIn the Search Widget, enter the ID number. This could include, for example:\n\n\nmanhole IDs: \nMH049K010\n\n\noutfall IDs: \nA-20Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nSearch\n Button (the magnifying glass icon).\n\n\n\n\nA dropdown will appear with search results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking the result in the dropdown, the map will pan and zoom to that location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you enter a partial ID number, the search will return related results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. View and Interact with Sewer Data\n\n\nOnce you have found the location of interest, you may need to identify specific pieces of infrastructure nearby. There are a few ways to make sure the map allows you to see the infrastructure you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nWastewater Infrastructure Layers\n\n\nThis being a sewer infrastructure atlas, the map by default shows the key elements of the regional wastewater infrastructure: pipes, structures, and virtual laterals.\n\n\nThe map \nLegend\n in the \nInformation Window\n summarizes the symbols for wastewater infrastructure features that are visible on the map. The legend will change dynamically depending on the layers shown on the map.\n\n\nPipes\n\n\nSo that you may quickly get a sense of the hierarchy of the wastewater network, the pipes are shown on the map in classes by diameter in inches as follows:\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Laterals\n\n\nZooming in far enough on the map will reveal \nvirtual laterals.\n Note that virtual laterals do not represent actual pipes, but indicate likely connections from buildings to the nearest municipal pipe.\n\n\nFlow Direction\n\n\nOn both Pipes and Virtual Laterals, \nArrows\n indicate the direction of wastewater flow.\n\n\nStructures\n\n\nWastewater structures are points on the map, illustrated with symbols that denote general function:\n\n\n\n\nStructures will appear at higher zoom levels.\n\n\nGet information about Wastewater Infrastructure Layers\n\n\nThe wastewater infrastructure data shown on the map has numerous informational attributes about the infrastructure. To see these attributes, simply click on a feature. A pop-up window will appear.\n\n\n\n\nThis window contains key attributes, such as the wastewater structure ID, the X/Y coordinates, and pipe sizes, and the ALCOSAN point of connection ID.\n\n\nNote: coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are currently shown in the\n \nNAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272).\n \nThis differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget described above\n\n\nText at the very top of the window will indicate if one or more features have been selected.\n\n\n\n\nThis will often happen if you select, for example, a manhole, which will have one or more pipes attached to it, or any other features in very close proximity to one another. Use the arrows on the top right side of the pop-up window to quickly cycle through the attributes of nearby infrastructure.\n\n\nGet the X/Y coordinates of a specific wastewater structure\n\n\nNote: currently the coordinates in the pop-up for wastewater structures are shown in the\n \nNAD 1983 - State Plane - Pennsylvania South FIPS 3702 Feet reference system (EPSG: 2272).\n \nThis differs from the global mercator coordinates use in the search widget. While both systems are accurately used to show data on this map, a future release will provide the wastewater structure coordinates in a manner consistent with other coordinates displayed on the map\n\n\nTo get the coordinates for a specific wastewater structure, use the coordinate display at the bottom of the map window.\n\n\n\n\nThe coordinates are updated based on the position of the mouse over the map. To get the coordinates for a specific location (and keep them from changing when the pointer moves):\n\n\n\n\nclick the button shown to the left of the coordinates (noted in the image above with a red arrow).\n\n\nclick the location on the map (such as on the wastewater structure) that you need the coordinates for.\n\n\n\n\nThe coordinates will remain until the user clicks on the map again, or toggles the button.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Trace the Sewer Network\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have found your location of interest and identified the sewer infrastructure you are interested in, you can begin to figure out where possible illicit discharges might be coming from by tracing the sewer network. The \nNetwork Trace\n widget automates this analysis for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the \nNetwork Trace\n widget in the \nInformation Window\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nFlag\n button in the widget, and then click on the map on top of the infrastructure at the location from which you want to trace. You will likely want to place the flag directly on the manhole or other structure from which you are conducting the analysis, but the trace can run from any location on the pipe.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the flag you place will be automatically snapped to the nearest pipe or structure for the analysis, so it is OK if you don\u2019t place it precisely!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the widget window, click the \nTrace\n button, and the analysis will start. Depending on how many pipes are traced, the analysis may take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two to complete.\n\n\nYou can continue to do other things with Atlas, such as pan and zoom or turn layers on and off, while the trace analysis runs.\n\n\nWhen the analysis is complete, the results of the trace are added to the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupstream pipes\n are highlighted in orange\n\n\nupstream structures\n are highlighted in orange\n\n\ndownstream pipes\n are highlighted in green\n\n\ndownstream structures\n structures are highlighted in green\n\n\n\n\nAs with the wastewater structure layers, you can click on the trace results on the map to view attributes of the infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy clicking the \nClear\n button in the widget, the network trace results and any \nFlag\n inputs will be removed from the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Identify sample points upstream\n\n\nOnce you can see results of the trace on the map, you can go back and use available layers to help identify potential sample points and discharge sources.\n\n\nUpstream wastewater structures and pipes\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed a trace, \nupstream pipes\n and \nupstream structures\n will be shown on the map highlighted in orange. You can click on the orange pipes and orange structure to get the same pop-up information you could see without the trace, as described above.\n\n\nVirtual Laterals\n\n\nEven though \nVirtual laterals\n are not traced with the network trace widget, use them in conjunction with the orange upstream trace results as a visual reference, to help identify possible discharge sources. Virtual laterals are mapped from the center of buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Printing\n\n\nInstead of taking screenshots to capture the current map view, using the \nPrint\n widget. This widget allows you to \u201cprint\u201d your current map view direct to a \n.pdf\n file or one of several image file formats, with the added benefit of providing a complete map layout with legend, scale, and title. By default the widget will generate an 8.5 x 11 inch \n.pdf\n map.\n\n\nTo print:\n\n\n\n\nsimply adjust the view of the map to the view you would like to save.\n\n\nselect\n\n\n\n\nThe print window includes an advanced options button that allows the user to customize the map title, author, image resolution, and other details.\n\n\n\n\nThe print job is sent to a remote server, and may take some time to complete. You can use the rest of the Atlas while waiting - the job will complete in the background and notify you when ready.\n\n\nSupporting Functionality\n\n\nThe Base Map and other supplementary map data\n\n\nBy default, imagery from \nAllegheny\n County with streets and points of interest from \nEsri\n is displayed with the wastewater network data.\n\n\nOther reference layers\n\n\nClicking the \nMap Layers\n widget in the \nInformation Window\n displays all layers available to be  shown on the map. These can individually be turned on or off; transparency can also be adjusted.",

We conducted in-person review of edits with the data maintainer on 21 March 2018.\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\n\n\nUpdates reflect major infrastructure upgrades in Trafford, North Versailles/East McKeesport (5th Ave).\n\n\nGeometry matching or attribute updates was not explicitly performed on pipes/structures within the RI Extents (referencing November 2017 RI Extent data); note though that in several edge cases where connectivity issues cropped up with submitted data, we did make minor geometry edits merely to ensure geometric network connectivity was maintained.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\nCorrection to ownership: Pipes classified as \nNVER\n in the last release were done by mistake. North Versailles Township (\nNVER\n) does not own wastewater infrastructure. It is all owned/maintained by the municipal authority (\nNVTS\n). This has been corrected.\n\n\nSome submitted wastewater data included separate stormwater infrastructure, misclassified as \nSAN\n, which came up during review. We reclassified these as \nSTM\n and changed \ndisabled\n to \nfalse\n. The records are retained in this way, but won\u2019t show on the Sewer Atlas and won\u2019t be included in the network trace.\n\n\n\n\n2017-Q4 (v6.0.0)\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe 2017-Q4 update encompassed a major update to the data model, data updates from several community datasets, and one round of review with the source data maintainer, Glenn Engineering.\n\n\nModel Updates\n\n\n\n\nThe Sewer Atlas database schema is now better aligned with the ALCOSAN Regionalization database schema.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sewer Atlas data model received a major house-cleaning for this update. This entailed the normalization of field values throughout the database.\n\n\nThe goal of this effort was to clean-up the way that data classifications are represented, and update them to match the latest standards in place by ALCOSAN (w/ AECOM) for the Regionalization project. Through this effort, we did not look to change the classification (i.e., we did not reclassify any records to represent something else) for any given record.\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE: the values \nYes\n, \nYES\n, \nY\n, \nTrue\n, \n1\n were all found in the \nALCOSAN\n field, which is a simple boolean-esque field indicating whether or not ALCOSAN owns the infrastructure; such values all become re-coded as \nY\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhere possible, the cleaned-up values were made to conform to the data model in use for ALCOSAN\u2019s RI initiative (developed by AECOM).

The Sewer Atlas data model received a major house-cleaning for this update. This entailed the normalization of field values throughout the database.  The goal of this effort was to clean-up the way that data classifications are represented, and update them to match the latest standards in place by ALCOSAN (w/ AECOM) for the Regionalization project. Through this effort, we did not look to change the classification (i.e., we did not reclassify any records to represent something else) for any given record.   EXAMPLE: the values  Yes ,  YES ,  Y ,  True ,  1  were all found in the  ALCOSAN  field, which is a simple boolean-esque field indicating whether or not ALCOSAN owns the infrastructure; such values all become re-coded as  Y .   Where possible, the cleaned-up values were made to conform to the data model in use for ALCOSAN\u2019s RI initiative (developed by AECOM). In cases where values present in the Sewer Atlas database did not have a corresponding code/value in the ALCOSAN RI data model, we fell back to the original Landbase Systems data dictionary for the old One Overall Map. In the few remaining cases, we left the values as-is, and anticipate addressing them as we continue to make updates.
